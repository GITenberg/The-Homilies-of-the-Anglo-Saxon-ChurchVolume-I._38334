<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />
  <p>The work now presented to the Members of the Ælfric Society, the first
  fruit of its praiseworthy attempt to rescue from oblivion the literary
  remains of our forefathers, was selected for the earliest publication of
  the Society, on account both of its valuable matter and the beautiful
  medium by which it is conveyed.</p>
  <p>Of the author of the <span class="sc">Sermones Catholici</span> we
  know nothing with certainty beyond his name, though from the words of his
  own preface, where he speaks of king Æthelred's days as past, and informs
  us that in those days he was only a monk and mass-priest, it follows that
  he was not Ælfric archbishop of Canterbury, who died in the year 1006, or
  ten years before the death of king Æthelred.</p>
  <p>With better foundation we may assume him to have been Ælfric
  archbishop of York, who presided over that see from the year 1023 to
  1051<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Against this
  supposition there seems no objection on the score of dates, and that the
  composer of the 'Sermones' was a person of eminence during the life of
  archbishop <!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>Wulfstan, of whom, according to our
  hypothesis, he was the immediate successor, is evident from the language
  of his Canons, and of his Pastoral Epistle to Wulfstan, in which he
  speaks as one having authority; though in the first-mentioned of these
  productions he styles himself simply "humilis frater," and in the other
  "Ælfricus abbas<a name="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>," and
  afterwards "biscop."</p>
  <p>Of Ælfric's part in these Homilies, whether, as it would seem from his
  preface, it was that of a mere translator from the several works he
  therein names<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, or whether
  he drew aught from his own stores, my pursuits do not enable me to speak,
  though it seems that no one of his homilies is, generally speaking, a
  mere translation from any one given Latin original, but rather a
  compilation from several. Be this, however, as it may, his sermons in
  either case equally exhibit what were the doctrines of the Anglo-Saxon
  church at the period in which they were compiled or translated, and are
  for the most part valuable in matter, and expressed in language which may
  be pronounced a pure specimen of our noble, old, Germanic mother-tongue.
  Of those doctrines it would not be consistent with the object of the
  Society, nor am I qualified to hazard an opinion: my labour has, <!--
  Page vii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevii"></a>{vii}</span>consequently, been limited to that of a
  faithful transcription of what I believe to be the most complete
  manuscript, and to a conscientiously correct translation of that
  transcript, as literal as my acquaintance with the language and my
  notions of good taste permitted<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>; and I venture to hope that such a
  translation, though unattended by a commentary, will be regarded with
  interest by the members of each of the great communities into which the
  Christian world is divided.</p>
  <p>Besides the Homilies, the chief works attributed to our Ælfric
  are,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote class="b1n">
  <p>I. A Grammar of the Latin tongue, printed at the end of Somner's
  Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, with a Glossary of Anglo-Saxon words<a
  name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>II. A short astronomical treatise, entitled De Temporibus Anni<a
  name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>III. An abridgment in Anglo-Saxon of the <!-- Page viii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span>Pentateuch, the book
  of Joshua, and the book of Judges, printed by Thwaites<a name="NtA_7"
  href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>IV. A Treatise on the Old and New Testaments<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>V. Excerpta ex Libro Æthelwoldi de Consuetudine Monachorum<a
  name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>VI. A Latin Dialogue, with an interlinear Anglo-Saxon gloss<a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>VII. Ecclesiastical Canons, addressed to Wulsine, bishop of
  Sherborne.</p>
  <p>VIII. A Pastoral Epistle, written by command of archbishop
  Wulfstan.</p>
  <p>IX. An Epistle entitled "Quando dividis Chrisma<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>."</p>
<p><!-- Page ix --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pageix"></a>{ix}</span></p>
  <p>X. A Collection of Homilies on the Saints' days observed by the
  Anglo-Saxon Church.</p>
</blockquote>
  <p>Though the present is the first edition of these most ancient sermons
  in any of the Germanic tongues, it may be interesting to some readers to
  be informed that two attempts at publishing them were made in the early
  part of the last century by Mrs. Elizabeth Elstob, which failed through
  want of encouragement, a few leaves only having been printed<a
  name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>In assigning to Ælfric, archbishop of York, the honour of being the
  author of the Homilies and other works enumerated above, it would have
  been gratifying to add, that the character of that prelate given by the
  chroniclers was beyond a doubt all that could be desired, and such as to
  render it highly probable that to him we are indebted for those noble and
  holy labours. Unfortunately the case is otherwise, the few facts recorded
  of Ælfric of York being for the most part quite irreconcileable with the
  portrait of the pious student which our imagination spontaneously draws,
  on calling to mind the exertions in the cause of religion and learning
  attributed to our Ælfric. Of the archbishop, Malmesbury speaks in terms
  of <!-- Page x --><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex"></a>{x}</span>no
  ordinary severity, asserting, that at his instigation Hardacnut caused
  the corpse of his brother Harald Harefoot to be taken from the grave and
  decapitated, and afterwards thrown into the Thames; also, that being
  exasperated against the people of Worcester, who had rejected him for
  their bishop, he again instigated the same king to burn their city and
  confiscate their property, under the pretext of their having resisted the
  royal tax-gatherers<a name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.
  The better testimony of Florence of Worcester, with regard to the first
  of these transactions, is, however, less prejudicial to the character of
  Ælfric: he says merely, that Ælfric, archbishop of York, with others was
  sent to London by the king for the purpose of digging up the body of
  Harald and casting it into a fen<a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. Of the second transaction Florence
  makes no mention. But the earliest account is that in the Saxon
  Chronicle<a name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>, and in this
  it is simply said, that "he (Harthacnut) caused the dead body of Harald
  to be taken up, and had it cast into a fen:" to Ælfric and the others
  there is no allusion whatever. In the same record his death is mentioned
  in the following terms of respect: "This year (1052) died Ælfric,
  archbishop of York, a very venerable and wise man." It is also stated
  that he was the accuser of earl Godwine, of the earl of Kent, and of
  Living, bishop of Worcester, as the murderers of the young Ælfred, the
  son of Æthelred<a name="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>The manuscript from which the text of the present volume is taken
  belongs to the Public Library at <!-- Page xi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagexi"></a>{xi}</span>Cambridge. It is a small folio and probably
  coeval with its author, though hardly, as it has been supposed, his own
  autograph copy<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>. It is
  not perfect, having suffered mutilation in several places, but its
  defects are all supplied in the present work from another MS. in the
  British Museum<a name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>. For the
  most liberal use of the Cambridge manuscript, I beg leave, on the part of
  the Ælfric Society, to express the sincerest thanks to the <span
  class="sc">Syndics of that University</span>.</p>
  <p>To <span class="sc">W. E. Buckley</span>, Esq., Fellow of Brasenose
  College, and Professor of Anglo-Saxon in the University of Oxford, I
  return my sincere thanks for his kindness in removing my doubts of the
  integrity of the text by collation with the Bodleian manuscript; also to
  my greatly respected friend, the <span class="sc">Reverend Daniel Rock,
  D.D.</span>, I acknowledge myself much indebted for the kind promptness
  with which he at all times satisfied my inquiries respecting the ancient
  observances of the Church, as well as other points of doubt, which his
  deep knowledge of ecclesiastical antiquities so well qualifies him to
  solve.</p>
  <p>The second volume, containing Homilies for another year, is in
  preparation, and will, it is hoped, be laid before the Members of the
  Society in the course of the year 1845.</p>

  Biogr. Brit. Lit. p. 482, <i>n.</i> &Dagger;</p>
  <p><a name="Nt_3" href="#NtA_3">[3]</a> Among his sources he mentions
  Smaragdus and Haymo: of these the former was abbot of St. Mihiel, a
  monastery in the diocese of Verdun, in the eighth century. He wrote
  commentaries on the Scriptures, Sermons, etc. Haymo was bishop of
  Halberstadt, about the middle of the ninth century: he compiled, from the
  works of the fathers, commentaries on almost every part of the
  Scriptures. There was also a Haymo of Canterbury, who wrote commentaries
  on the Pentateuch, Isaiah, etc., of whom see Biogr. Britan. Lit. vol. i.
  p. 510. The other sources mentioned by Ælfric are too well known to need
  further notice.</p>
  <p><a name="Nt_4" href="#NtA_4">[4]</a> It is right to observe, that in
  the MS. the texts taken from the Gospels are frequently of very great
  length; these I have ventured to abridge, presuming that all readers of
  the Homilies have a copy of the N. T. either in Anglo-Saxon or
  English.</p>

  That the author of the Grammar, the compiler of the Homilies and the
  translator of the Heptateuch was the same individual, is evident from the
  prefaces to those works.</p>
  <p><a name="Nt_6" href="#NtA_6">[6]</a> Published at the expense of the
  Historical Society of Science, in a volume entitled 'Popular Treatises on
  Science written during the Middle Ages,' edited by Thomas Wright, Esq.,
  M.A., F.S.A., etc. etc. 8vo. 1841. That this work is by our Ælfric is
  evident from his own words immediately following his last homily: Her
  æfter fyligð án lytel cwyde be gearlicum tidum, þæt nis to spelle
  geteald, ac elles to rædenne þam ðe hit licað.&mdash;<i>Hereafter follows
  a little discourse concerning yearly tides, which is not reckoned as a
  sermon, but is else to be read by those whom it pleases.</i> MS. Cantab.

  <p><a name="Nt_9" href="#NtA_9">[9]</a> An edition of the Anglo-Saxon
  text of this work, with a translation by W. E. Buckley, Esq., Fellow of
  Brasenose Coll. and Prof. of A.-S. in the Univ. of Oxf., is announced for
  early publication by the Ælfric Society. The ealdorman Æthelweard, son of
  Æthelmær, mentioned in the preface to the Homilies and other works of
  Ælfric, is without doubt the chronicler of that name, concerning whom see
  Literary Introd. to Lappenberg's 'History of England under the
  Anglo-Saxon Kings,' p. xlv.</p>
  <p><a name="Nt_10" href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> According to the Oxford MS. of
  this Colloquium, it was originally composed by Ælfric (of Canterbury or
  York?) and enlarged by his pupil Ælfric Bata. It is printed in the
  'Analecta Anglo-Saxonica.' For more ample information concerning the
  Ælfrics the reader is referred to Mr. Wright's interesting and useful
  publication, 'Biographia Britannica Literaria; Anglo-Saxon Period,'
  edited for the Royal Society of Literature.</p>
  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> The three last-mentioned works
  are printed, with a translation, in the 'Ancient Laws and Institutes of
  England.' It appears from a note at the end of Matthew in the C.C.C.C.
  MS. of the Saxon Gospels, that an Ælfric was either the translator or
  copier of the Gospel of St. Matthew, if not of the four Gospels. See
  Notes to my edition of the Anglo-Saxon Gospels.</p>
  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> Elfrici Homiliæ, edit. El.
  Elstob. (fol. Oxon. 1715.) Of this first attempt only thirty-six pages
  were printed. Her second attempt was under the title, "The English-Saxon
  Homilies of Ælfric, Archb. of Cant., who flourished in the latter end of
  the tenth century and the beginning of the eleventh. Being a course of
  Sermons collected out of the writings of the ancient Latin Fathers,
  containing the Doctrines, etc. of the Church of England before the Norman
  Conquest, etc. etc. Now first printed, and translated into the language
  of the present times by Eliz. Elstob. fol. Oxon. 1715." Of this only two
  leaves were printed. A copy of both is in the Brit. Mus. See Biogr. Brit.
  Lit. p. 493. Mrs. Elstob also published Ælfric's Homily on the birth-day
  of St. Gregory, with a translation. 8vo. 1709. Reprinted with some
  account of Mrs. Elstob in 1839.</p>

<h3>INCIPIT PRÆFATIO HUJUS LIBRI.</h3>
  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />
<p class="cenhead">IN NOMINE DOMINI.</p>
  <p>Ego Ælfricus, alumnus Adelwoldi, benevoli et venerabilis Presulis,
  salutem exopto Domno Archiepiscopo Sigerico in Domino. Licet temere vel
  presumptuose, tamen transtulimus hunc codicem ex libris Latinorum,
  scilicet Sancte Scripture in nostram consuetam sermocinationem, ob
  ædificationem simplicium, qui hanc norunt tantummodo locutionem, sive
  legendo sive audiendo; ideoque nec obscura posuimus verba, sed simplicem
  Anglicam, quo facilius possit ad cor pervenire legentium vel audientium,
  ad utilitatem animarum suarum, quia alia lingua nesciunt erudiri, quam in
  qua nati sunt. Nec ubique transtulimus verbum ex verbo, sed sensum ex
  sensu, cavendo tamen diligentissime deceptivos errores, ne inveniremur
  aliqua hæresi seducti seu fallacia fuscati. Hos namque auctores in hac
  explanatione sumus sequuti, videlicet Augustinum Hipponensem, Hieronimum,
  Bedam, Gregorium, Smaragdum, et aliquando Haymonem; horum denique
  auctoritas ab omnibus catholicis libentissime suscipitur. Nec solum
  Evangeliorum tractatus in isto libello exposuimus, verum etiam Sanctorum
  passiones vel vitas, ad utilitatem idiotarum istius gentis. Quadraginta
  sententias in isto libro posuimus, credentes hoc sufficere posse per
  annum fidelibus, si integre eis a ministris Dei recitentur in ecclesia.
  Alterum vero librum modo dictando habemus in manibus, qui illos tractatus
  vel passiones continet quos iste omisit; nec tamen omnia Evangelia
  tangimus per circulum anni, sed illa tantummodo quibus speramus sufficere
  posse simplicibus ad <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page2"></a>{2}</span>animarum emendationem, quia seculares omnia
  nequeunt capere, quamvis ex ore doctorum audiant. Duos libros in ista
  translatione facimus, persuadentes ut legatur unus per annum in ecclesia
  Dei, et alter anno sequenti, ut non fiat tedium auscultantibus; tamen
  damus licentiam, si alicui melius placet, ad unum librum ambos ordinare.
  Ergo si alicui displicit, primum in interpretatione, quod non semper
  verbum ex verbo, aut quod breviorem explicationem quam tractatus auctorum
  habent, sive quod non per ordinem ecclesiastici ritus omnia Evangelia
  tractando percurrimus; <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page3"></a>{3}</span>condat sibi altiore interpretatione librum,
  quomodo intellectui ejus placet: tantum obsecro, ne pervertat nostram
  interpretationem, quam speramus ex Dei gratia, non causa jactantiæ, nos
  studiose secuti valuimus interpretari. Precor modo obnixe almitatem tuam,
  mitissime Pater <span class="sc">Sigerice</span>, ut digneris corrigere
  per tuam industriam, si aliquos nevos malignæ hæresis, aut nebulosæ
  fallaciæ in nostra interpretatione repperies: et adscribatur dehinc hic
  codicillus tuæ auctoritati, non utilitati nostræ despicabilis personæ.
  Vale in Deo Omnipotenti jugiter. Amen.</p>

  <p>I Ælfric, monk and mass-priest, although more weakly than for such
  orders is fitting, was sent, in king Æthelred's day, from bishop Ælfeah,
  Æthelwold's successor, to a minster which is called Cernel, at the prayer
  of <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'Æthelmære', corrected by errata."
  >Æthelmær</span> the thane, whose birth and goodness are known
  everywhere. Then it occurred to my mind, I trust through God's grace,
  that I would turn this book from the Latin language into the English
  tongue; not from confidence of great learning, but because I have seen
  and heard of much error in many English books, which unlearned men,
  through their simplicity, have esteemed as great wisdom: and I regretted
  that they knew not nor had not the evangelical doctrines among their
  writings, those men only excepted who knew Latin, and those books
  excepted which king Ælfred wisely turned from Latin into English, which
  are to be had. For this cause I presumed, trusting in God, to undertake
  this task, and also because men have need of good instruction, especially
  at this time, which is the ending of this world, and there will be many
  calamities among mankind before the end cometh, according to what our
  Lord in his gospel said to his disciples, "Then shall <!-- Page 5
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"></a>{5}</span>be such
  tribulations as have never been from the beginning of the world. Many
  false Christs shall come in my name, saying, 'I am Christ,' and shall
  work many signs and wonders, to deceive mankind; and also the elect, if
  it may be. And unless Almighty God shorten those days, all mankind will
  perish; but for his elect he will shorten those days." Everyone may the
  more easily withstand the future temptation, through God's support, if he
  is strengthened by book learning, for they shall be preserved who
  continue in faith to the end. Many tribulations and hardships shall come
  on this world before its end, and those are the proclaimers of
  everlasting perdition to evil men, who afterwards for their crimes suffer
  eternally in the swart hell. Then Antichrist shall come, who is human man
  and true devil, as our Saviour is truly man and God in one person. And
  the visible devil shall then work innumerable miracles, and say that he
  himself is God, and will compel mankind to his heresy: but his time will
  not be long, for God's anger will destroy him, and this world will
  afterwards be ended. Christ our Lord healed the weak and diseased, and
  the devil, who is called Antichrist, which is interpreted,
  Opposition-Christ, weakens and enfeebles the hale, and heals no one from
  diseases, save those alone whom he himself had previously injured. He and
  his disciples injure men's bodies secretly through the devil's power, and
  heal them openly in the sight of men: but he may not heal those whom God
  himself had before afflicted. He compels, through wickedness, men to
  swerve from the faith of their Creator to his leasings, who is the author
  of all leasing and wickedness. Almighty God permits the impious
  Antichrist to work signs, and miracles, and persecution, for three years
  and a half; for in that time there will be so much wickedness and
  perversity among mankind, that they will be well worthy of devilish
  persecution, to the eternal perdition of those who incline unto him, and
  to the eternal joy of those who by faith resist him. God also permits
  that <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>{7}</span>his chosen servants be cleansed from all sins
  through great persecutions, as gold is tried in fire. The devil slays
  those who withstand him, and then, with holy martyrdom, they go to the
  kingdom of heaven. Those who believe in his leasings, those he honours,
  and they shall have afterwards eternal torment for reward of their sin.
  The impious one will cause fire to come from above, as it were from
  heaven, in sight of men, as if he were God Almighty, who rules over
  heaven and earth; but Christians must then be mindful how the devil did,
  when he prayed to God that he might tempt Job; he made fire to come from
  above, as if from heaven, and burned all his sheep out in the field, and
  the shepherds also, save one who should announce it to him. The devil
  sent not fire from heaven, though it came from above; for he himself was
  not in heaven, after that he, for his pride, had been cast out. Nor also
  hath the cruel Antichrist the power to send down heavenly fire, though
  he, through the devil's craft, may so pretend. It will now be wiser that
  everyone know this, and know his belief, lest anyone have to await great
  misery. Our Lord commanded his disciples that they should instruct and
  teach all people the things which he had himself taught to them; but of
  those there are too few who will well teach and well exemplify. The Lord
  also cried, through his prophet Ezechiel, "If thou warnest not the
  unrighteous, and exhortest him not, so that he turn from his wickedness
  and live, then shall the wicked die in his iniquity, and I will require
  from thee his blood," that is, his perdition. "But if thou warnest the
  wicked, and he will not turn from his wickedness, thou shalt release thy
  soul with that admonition, and the wicked shall die in his
  unrighteousness." Again the Almighty spake to the prophet Isaiah, "Cry
  and cease thou not, raise thy voice as a trumpet, and declare to my
  people their crimes, and to the family of Jacob their sins." From such
  commands it appeared to me that I should not be guiltless before God, if
  I would not declare to <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page9"></a>{9}</span>other men, by tongue or by writings, the
  evangelical truth, which he himself spake, and afterwards to holy
  teachers revealed. Very many I know in this country more learned than I
  am, but God manifests his wonders through whom he will. As an almighty
  worker he works his work through his chosen, not because he has need of
  our aid, but that we may earn eternal life by the performance of his
  work. Paul the apostle said, "We are God's assistants," and yet we do
  nothing for God without the assistance of God. Now I desire and beseech,
  in God's name, if anyone will transcribe this book, that he carefully
  correct it by the copy, lest we be blamed through careless writers. He
  does great evil who writes false, unless he correct it; it is as though
  he turn true doctrine to false error; therefore should everyone make that
  straight which he before bent crooked, if he will be guiltless at God's
  doom. Quid necesse est in hoc codice capitula ordinare, cum prædiximus

  <p>There is one origin of all things, that is God Almighty. He is
  beginning and end: he is beginning, because he was ever; he is end
  without any ending, because he is ever unended. He is King of all kings,
  and Lord of all lords. He holdeth with his might heavens, and earth, and
  all creatures, without toil, and he beholdeth the depths which are under
  this earth. He weigheth all hills with one hand, and no thing <!-- Page
  11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>may withstand
  his will. No creature may perfectly search out nor understand concerning
  God: greater affinity have angels to God than men, and yet they may not
  perfectly understand concerning God. He created those creatures that he
  would; through his wisdom he wrought all things, and through his will he
  endued them all with life. This Trinity is one God, that is, the Father,
  and his Wisdom, of himself ever produced; and the Will of them both, that
  is, the Holy Ghost: he is not born, but he goeth alike from the Father
  and from the Son. These three persons are one Almighty God, who wrought
  the heavens, and the earth, and all creatures. He created ten hosts of
  angels, that is angels and archangels, throni, dominationes, principatus,
  potestates, virtutes, cherubim, seraphim. Here are nine hosts of angels:
  they have no body, but they are all spirits, very strong, and mighty, and
  beautiful, formed with great fairness, to the praise and glory of their
  Creator. The tenth host rebelled and turned to evil. God created them all
  good, and let them have their own discretion, whether they would love and
  follow their Creator, or would forsake him. Now the prince of the tenth
  host was formed very fair and beauteous, so that he was called
  'Light-bearing' (Lucifer). Then he began to wax proud by reason of the
  comeliness that he had, and said in his heart that he would and easily
  might be equal to his Creator, and sit in the north part of heaven's
  kingdom, and have power and sway against God Almighty. Then he confirmed
  this resolve with the host over which he ruled, and they all bowed to
  that resolve. When they all had confirmed this resolve among themselves,
  God's anger came over them all, and they were all changed from the fair
  form in which they were created to loathly devils. And very rightly it so
  befell him, when he would in pride be better than he was created, and
  said that he might be equal to Almighty God. Then became he and all his
  associates more wicked and worse than any other creatures; and while he
  meditated how he might share power <!-- Page 13 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>{13}</span>with God, the Almighty
  Creator prepared hell-torment for him and his associates, and drove them
  all from the joy of heaven's kingdom, and caused them to fall into the
  eternal fire that was prepared for them for their pride. Then forthwith
  the nine hosts that were left bowed to their Creator with all humbleness,
  and resigned their purpose to his will. Then the Almighty God confirmed
  and established the nine hosts of angels, so that they never might or
  would afterwards swerve from his will; nor can they now perpetrate any
  sin, but they are ever meditating only how they may obey God and be
  acceptable to him. So might also the others who fell have done if they
  had been willing; seeing that God had made them of the beauteous nature
  of angels, and let them have their own will, and would never have
  inclined nor forced them in any way to that evil counsel; for the evil
  counsel never came from God's conception, but came from the devil's, as
  we before said.</p>

  <p>Now many a man will think and inquire, whence the devil came? be it,
  therefore, known to him that God created as a great angel him who is now
  the devil: but God did not create him as the devil: but when he was
  wholly fordone and guilty towards God, through his great haughtiness and
  enmity, then became he changed to the devil, who before was created a
  great angel. Then would God supply and make good the loss that had been
  suffered in the heavenly host, and said that he would make man of earth,
  so that the earthly man should prosper, and merit with meekness those
  dwellings in the kingdom of heaven which the devil through his pride had
  forfeited. And God then wrought a man of clay, and blew spirit into him,
  and animated him, and he became a man formed with soul and body; and God
  bestowed on him the name of Adam, and he was for some time standing
  alone. God then brought him into Paradise, and established him there, and
  said unto him, "Of all the things which are in Paradise thou mayest eat,
  and they shall all be committed to <!-- Page 15 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>{15}</span>thee, save one tree which
  stands in the middle of Paradise: touch thou not the fruit of this tree;
  for thou shalt be mortal if thou eatest the fruit of this tree." Why
  would God forbid him so little a thing, when he had committed to him
  other things so great? But how could Adam know what he was, unless he
  were obedient in some thing to his Lord? as if God had said to him, "Thou
  knowest not that I am thy Lord, and that thou art my servant, unless thou
  dost that which I command, and forgoest that which I forbid thee. But
  what may it be that thou shalt forgo? I say unto thee, forgo thou the
  fruit of one tree, and with that easy obedience thou shalt merit the joys
  of heaven, and the place from which the devil fell through disobedience.
  But if thou breakest this little commandment, thou shalt perish by
  death." And then was Adam so wise that God led to him the cattle, and
  brute race, and bird race, when he had created them; and Adam made names
  for them all; and so as he named them are they yet called. Then said God,
  "It is not fitting that this man be alone, and have no help; now let us
  make him a mate for help and comfort." And God then caused Adam to sleep,
  and as he slept, he took a rib from his side, and of that rib wrought a
  woman, and asked Adam how she should be called. Then said Adam, "She is
  bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh; be her name Virago, that is
  <i>female</i>; because she is taken from her husband." Then Adam
  afterwards bestowed on her another name, Eva, that is <i>life</i>;
  because she is the mother of all living.</p>

  <p>All creatures, heavens and angels, sun and moon, stars and earth, all
  beasts and birds, the sea and all fishes, and all creatures, God created
  and wrought in six days; and on the seventh day he ended his work, and
  ceased, and hallowed the seventh day, because on that day he ended his
  work. And he beheld then all his works that he had wrought, and they were
  all exceedingly good. All things he wrought without any matter. He said,
  "Let there be light," and instantly <!-- Page 17 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>{17}</span>there was light. He said
  again, "Let there be heaven," and instantly heaven was made, as he with
  his wisdom and his will had appointed it. He said again, and bade the
  earth bring forth all living cattle, and he then created of earth all the
  race of cattle, and the brute race, all those which go on four feet; in
  like manner of water he created fishes and birds, and gave the power of
  swimming to the fishes, and flight to the birds; but he gave no soul to
  any beast, nor to any fish; but their blood is their life, and as soon as
  they are dead they are totally ended. When he had made the man Adam, he
  did not say, "Let man be made," but he said, "Let us make man in our
  likeness," and he then made man with his hands, and blew into him a soul;
  therefore is man better, if he grow up in good, than all the beasts are;
  because they will all come to naught, and man is in one part eternal,
  that is in the soul; that will never end. The body is mortal through
  Adam's sin, but, nevertheless, God will raise again the body to eternity
  on doomsday. Now the heretics say that the devil created some creatures,
  but they lie; he can create no creatures, for he is not a creator, but is
  a loathsome fiend, and with leasing he will deceive and fordo the unwary;
  but he may not compel any man to any crime, unless the man voluntarily
  incline to his teaching. Whatsoever among things created seems pernicious
  and is injurious to men, is all for our sins and evil deserts.</p>

  <p>When the devil understood that Adam and Eve were created, that they
  might with meekness and obedience merit the dwelling in the kingdom of
  heaven from which he had fallen for his haughtiness, then he felt great
  anger and envy towards those persons, and meditated how he might fordo
  them. He came then in a serpent's form to the two persons, first to the
  woman, and said to her, "Why has God forbidden you the fruit of this
  tree, which stands in the middle of Paradise?" Then said the woman, "God
  forbade us the fruit of the tree <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  God knows full well, if ye eat of that tree that your eyes will then be
  opened, and ye can see and know both good and evil, and ye will be like
  to angels." They were not created blind, but God created them so
  simple-minded that they knew nothing evil, neither by sight, nor by
  speech, nor by deed. But the woman was seduced by the devil's counsel,
  and took of the fruit of the tree, and ate, and gave to her consort, and
  he ate. Then they both became mortal, and knew both good and evil; and
  they were naked, and thereat they were ashamed. Then came God and asked
  why he had broken his commandment? and drove them both from Paradise, and
  said, "Because thou wast obedient to the words of thy wife, and
  despisedst my commandment, thou shalt get thee food with hardships, and
  the earth, which is accursed through thy deed, shall give thee thorns and
  brambles. Thou art taken from earth, and thou shalt to earth return. Thou
  art dust, and thou shalt turn to dust." God then wrought for them
  garments of skins, and they were clothed with the skins.</p>

  alone is God, was despised and dishonoured. There was, nevertheless, one
  family which had never bent to any idol, but had ever worshipped the true
  God. That family sprang from Noah's eldest son, who was called Shem: he
  lived six hundred years, and his son was called Arphaxad, who lived three
  hundred and thirty-three years, and his son was called Salah, who lived
  four hundred and thirty-three years, when he begat a son who was called
  Eber, from whom sprang the Hebrew people, whom God loved: and from that
  race came all the patriarchs and prophets, those who announced Christ's
  advent to this life; that he would be man before the end of this world,
  for our redemption, he who ever was God with the supreme Father. And for
  this race God gave and established a law, and he led them over the sea
  with dry feet, and he fed them forty years with heavenly bread, and
  wrought many miracles among the people; because he would choose him a
  mother from this race.</p>

  <p>Then at last, when the time came that God had foreseen, he sent his
  angel Gabriel to a maiden of that race, who was called Mary. Then came
  the angel to her, and greeted her with God's words, and announced to her,
  that God's Son should be born of her, without communion of man. And she
  believed his words, and became with child. When her time was come she
  brought forth, and continued a maiden. That child is twice born: he is
  born of the Father in heaven, without any mother, and again, when he
  became man, he was born of the pure virgin Mary, without any earthly
  father. God the Father made mankind and all creatures through the Son;

  <p>Then the Jewish people showed great envy of his doctrine, and
  meditated how they might put him to death. Now was one of the twelve of
  Christ's companions, who was called Judas, seduced by the instigation of
  the devil, and he went to the Jewish people, and consulted with them how
  he might betray Christ unto them. Though all people were gathered
  together they all might not destroy him, if he himself willed it not;
  therefore he came to us because he would suffer death for us, and so, by
  his own death, redeem all mankind who believe from hell's torment. He
  would not take us forcibly from the devil's power, unless he had
  forfeited it; but he forfeited it entirely when he whetted and instigated
  the hearts of the Jewish men to the slaying of Christ. Then Christ
  consented that the bloodthirsty ones should take him, and bind, and, hung
  on a cross, slay him. Verily then two believing men honourably buried
  him; and Christ, in that time, <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  took from him Adam and Eve, and their offspring, that portion which had
  previously been most acceptable to him, and led them to their bodies, and
  arose from death with that great host on the third day of his passion:
  then came to his apostles, and comforted them, and for a space of forty
  days sojourned with them, and repeated the same doctrine which he had
  before taught them, and bade them go over all the earth, preaching
  baptism and true faith. Then, on the fortieth day of his resurrection,
  the Lord ascended to heaven in sight of them all, with the same body in
  which he had suffered, and sitteth on the right hand of his Father, and
  governeth all creatures. He hath opened to righteous men the entrance to
  his kingdom, and those who wholly despise his commandments shall be cast
  down into hell. Verily he shall come at the end of this world with great
  majesty, in clouds, and all those who have ever received a soul shall
  arise from death towards him; and he will then deliver the wicked to the
  devil, into the eternal fire of hell-torment; the righteous he will lead

  Roman emperor Octavianus made proclamation that all the world should be
  set down in writing. This enrolment was set forth from Cyrenius, the
  governor of Syria&mdash;that every man in general should declare his
  birth and his possession in the city to which he belonged. Then Joseph,
  the foster-father of Christ, went from the land of Galilee, from the city
  of Nazareth, to the Jewish city, which was of David, and was called
  Bethlehem, because he was of the tribe of David, and would acknowledge
  with Mary her birth, who was then great with child. Then it came to pass,
  while they were sojourning in the city of Bethlehem, that her time was
  fulfilled that she should bring forth, and she brought forth then her
  firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid the child
  in their asses' bin, because there was no room in the inn. And there were
  shepherds in the country watching over their flock; and lo, the angel of
  God stood before them, and God's brightness shone on them, and they were
  much afraid. Then said the angel of God to the shepherds, "Fear not, lo,
  I announce to you great joy, which shall come to all people; for now
  to-day is born to you a Saviour, Christ, in the city of David. Ye shall
  see this token, ye shall find the child wrapped in swaddling clothes, and
  laid in a bin." Then suddenly, after the angel's speech, there was seen a
  great multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and singing, "Gloria
  in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus bonæ voluntatis," that is in
  our tongue, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men who
  are of good will." And the angels then withdrew from their sight to
  heaven. The shepherds then spake among themselves, "Let us go to
  Bethlehem, and see the word that God hath manifested unto us." They came
  then quickly, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the child laid in a bin, as
  the angel had announced to them. But the shepherds understood the word
  that had been said to them concerning the child, and all wondered that
  heard it, and also at that which the shepherds said unto them. But Mary
  held <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  heart. Then the shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all
  the things which they had heard and seen, as had been said to them by the

  <p>My dearest brethren, our Saviour, the Son of God, co-eternal with, and
  equal to his Father, who was ever with him without beginning, vouchsafed
  that he would on this present day, for the redemption of the world, be
  corporally born of the Virgin Mary. He is Prince and Author of all things
  good and of peace, and he sent before his birth unwonted peace, for never
  was there such peace before that period in the world, as there was at the
  time of his birth; so that all the world was subjected to the empire of
  one man, and all mankind paid royal tribute to him alone. Verily in such
  great peace was Christ born, who is our peace, because he united angels
  and men to one family through his incarnation. He was born in the days of
  the emperor who was called Octavianus, who extended the Roman empire to
  that degree that all the world bowed to him, and he was, therefore, named
  Augustus, that is, <i>Increasing his empire</i>. The name befits the
  heavenly King Christ, who was born in his time, who increased his
  heavenly empire, and replenished with mankind the loss which the falling
  devil had caused in the host of angels. Not only did he simply supply its
  loss, but also greatly increased it. Verily as great a number of mankind
  cometh, through Christ's incarnation, to the hosts of angels, as there
  remained of holy angels in heaven after the devil's fall. The emperor's
  decree, which commanded all the world to be inscribed, betokened
  manifestly the deed of the heavenly King, who came into the world that he
  might gather his chosen from all nations, and write their names in
  everlasting bliss. This decree sprang from the governor
  Cyrenius&mdash;Cyrenius is interpreted <i>Heir</i>, and he betokened
  Christ, who is the true heir of the eternal Father; and he granteth us to
  be heirs with him, and partakers of his glory. <!-- Page 35 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>All nations then went
  that each separately might declare concerning himself, in the city to
  which he belonged. As at that time, according to the emperor's
  proclamation, each one singly, in their cities, declared concerning
  himself, so also now do our teachers make known to us Christ's
  proclamation, that we gather us to his holy congregation, and therein,
  with devout mind, pay to him the tribute of our faith, that our names may
  be written in the book of life with his chosen.</p>

  true bread, brought forth, who saith of himself, "I am the vital bread,
  which descended from heaven, and he who eateth of this bread shall not
  die to eternity." This holy bread we taste when we with faith go to
  housel; because the holy housel is spiritually Christ's body; and through
  that we are redeemed from eternal death. Mary brought forth her firstborn
  son on this present day, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and, for
  want of room, laid him in a bin. That child is not called her firstborn
  child because she afterwards brought forth another, but because Christ is
  the firstborn of many spiritual brothers. All christian men are his
  spiritual brothers, and he is the firstborn, in grace and in godliness
  only-begotten of the Almighty Father. He was wrapped in mean swaddling
  clothes, that he might give us the immortal garment which we lost by the
  first created man's transgression. The Almighty Son of God, whom the
  heavens could not contain, was laid in a narrow bin, that he might redeem
  us from the narrowness of hell. Mary was there a stranger, as the gospel
  tells us; and through the concourse of people the inn was greatly
  crowded.</p>

  <p>The Son of God was crowded in his inn, that he might give us a
  spacious dwelling in the kingdom of heaven, if we obey his will. He asks
  nothing of us as reward for his toil, except our soul's health, that we
  may prepare ourselves for him pure and uncorrupted in bliss and
  everlasting joy. The shepherds that watched over their flock at Christ's
  birth, betokened the holy teachers in God's church, who are the spiritual
  shepherds of faithful souls: and the angel announced Christ's birth to
  the herdsmen, because to the spiritual shepherds, that is, teachers, is
  chiefly revealed concerning Christ's humanity, through book-learning: and
  they shall sedulously preach to those placed under them, that which is
  manifested to them, as the shepherds proclaimed the heavenly vision. It
  beseemeth the teacher to be ever watchful over God's flock, that the
  invisible wolf scatter not the sheep.</p>

  <p>Oftentimes, in the ancient law, angels appeared to men, but it is not
  written that they came with light, for that honour was reserved for the
  greatness of this day, that they should manifest themselves with heavenly
  light, when that true light sprang up in darkness to the right thinkers,
  the merciful and righteous Lord. The angel said to the shepherds, "Be ye
  not afraid, lo, I announce to you great joy, which shall come to all
  people, for to-day is born a Saviour Christ in the city of David." Verily
  he announced great joy, which shall never end; for Christ's nativity
  gladdened the inhabitants of heaven, and of earth, and of hell. The angel
  said, "Now to-day is born to you a Saviour Christ, in the city of David:"
  rightly he said <i>to-day</i>, and not to-night, for Christ is the true
  day who scattered with his advent all the ignorance of the ancient night,
  and illumined all the world with his grace. The sign which the angel said
  to the shepherds we ought ever to hold in our remembrance, and to thank
  the Saviour that he so humbled himself that he was the partaker of our
  mortality, with human flesh invested, and wrapt in mean swaddling
  clothes. Then suddenly, after the angel's speech, was seen a great
  multitude <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page39"></a>{39}</span>of the heavenly host, praising God and
  singing, "Be glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men who
  are of good will." An angel announced to the shepherds the heavenly
  King's nativity, and suddenly appeared many thousand angels, lest the
  preeminence of one angel should seem too inadequate for so great an
  announcement: and they all together, with melodious song, God's glory
  celebrated, and to good men announced peace, manifestly showing that
  through his birth men shall be inclined to the peace of one faith, and to
  the glory of divine praise. They sung, "Be glory to God in the highest,
  and on earth peace to men, to those who are of good will." These words
  manifest that where the peace of God dwelleth, there is good will. But
  mankind had discord with angels before the Lord's nativity; because we
  were through sins estranged from God; then were we accounted estranged
  also from his angels: but after that the heavenly King assumed our
  earthly body, his angels turned to peace with us; and those whom they had
  before despised as mean they now honour as their companions. But in the
  ancient law, Lot, and Joshua, and certain others who saw angels, bowed
  before them, and prayed to them, and the angels allowed it: but when John
  the Evangelist, in the New Testament, would pray to the angel who spake
  to him, the angel forbade him, and said, "See that thou do not this deed;
  I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren: pray to God only." Angels
  permitted, before the advent of the Lord, mortal men to fall down before
  them, and after his advent forbade it; because they saw that their
  Creator had assumed that nature which they had before accounted mean, and
  durst not despise it in us, when they honour it above themselves in the
  heavenly King. Nor despise they the fellowship of men, when falling down
  they pray to the human God. Now we are accounted citizens of God, and
  like to angels; let us, therefore, take care that sins do not separate us
  from this great dignity. <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>Verily men are called gods; preserve,
  therefore, thou man, thy dignity of a god against sins, since God became
  man for thee.</p>

  <p>The shepherds then spake among themselves, after the departure of the
  angels, "Let us go to Bethlehem, and see the word which is come to pass,
  and that God hath revealed unto us." O how rightly they acknowledged the
  holy faith with these words, "In the beginning was the word, and the word
  was with God, and that word was God"! A word is the manifestation of
  wisdom, and the Word, that is Wisdom, is begotten of the Almighty Father,
  without beginning; for he was ever God of God, Wisdom of the wise Father.
  He is not made, for he is God, and not a creature; for the Almighty
  Father created all creatures through that Wisdom, and endowed them all
  with life through the Holy Ghost. Our human nature could not see Christ
  in that divine nativity; but that same Word became flesh and dwelt in us,
  that we might see him. The Word was not turned to flesh, but it was
  invested with human flesh. As every man existeth in soul and in body one
  man, so also Christ existeth in divine nature and human nature, in one
  person one Christ. They said, "Let us see the word that is come to pass,"
  because they could not see it before it was incarnate, and become man.
  Nevertheless, the divine nature is not mingled with the human nature, nor
  is there any separation. We might tell unto you a little simile, if it
  were not too mean; Look now on an egg, how the white is not mingled with
  the yolk, and yet it is one egg. Nor also is Christ's divinity confounded
  with human nature, but he continueth to all eternity in one person
  undivided.</p>

  <p>Then came the shepherds quickly, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the
  child laid in the bin. Mary was, by God's direction, betrothed to the
  righteous Joseph, for the greater security; because it was thus customary
  among the Jewish people, according to the law of Moses, that if any woman
  <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>{43}</span>had
  a child, save in lawful wedlock, she should be slain with stones. But God
  sent his angel to Joseph, when Mary was pregnant, and commanded that he
  should have care of her, and be the child's foster-father. Then it seemed
  to the Jews that Joseph was father of the child, but he was not; because
  the Almighty Creator had no need to be born of woman; but he took human
  nature from the womb of Mary, and left her a virgin undefiled, but
  hallowed through his birth. She knew no society of man, and she brought
  forth without pain, and continued in maidenhood. The shepherds saw and
  recognized the child, as had to them been told. (There is no happiness
  without knowledge of God, as Christ himself said, when he committed us to
  his Father, "That is eternal life that they acknowledge Thee, the true
  God, and him whom thou hast sent, the Saviour Christ.") Now all who heard
  that wondered greatly thereat, and at what the shepherds said. But Mary
  held all these words, pondering them in her heart. She would not publish
  Christ's mystery, but waited until he himself, when it pleased him,
  should divulge it. She knew God's law, and in the book of the prophets
  had read, that a virgin should give birth to God. Then she greatly
  rejoiced that she might be it. It was prophesied that he should be born
  in the city of Bethlehem, and she greatly wondered that, according to
  that prophecy, she was there delivered. She remembered that a prophet had
  said, "The ox knows his master, and the ass his master's bin." Then saw
  she the child lying in the bin, where the ox and the ass usually seek
  food. God's archangel Gabriel had announced to Mary the Saviour's coming
  into her womb, and she then saw that his announcement was truly
  fulfilled. Such words Mary held, pondering them in her heart. And the
  shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all those things which
  they had heard and seen, as had been told unto them.</p>

  <p>We read in the book which is called The Acts of the Apostles, that the
  apostles ordained seven deacons in the congregation which, from among the
  Jewish people, had turned to Christ's faith, after his passion, and
  resurrection from death, and ascension to heaven. Of these deacons the
  first was <span class="sc">Stephen</span>, to whom we do honour on this
  day. He was of great faith, and filled with the Holy Ghost. The six
  others were called by these names; Stephen was the first, the second
  Philip, the third Prochorus, the fourth Nicanor, the fifth Timothy, the
  sixth Parmenas, the seventh Nicolas. They chose these seven, and set them
  in the presence of the apostles, and they then, with prayers and
  blessings, were ordained deacons. The preaching of God waxed then daily,
  and the number of christian men was greatly multiplied in Jerusalem. Then
  was the blessed Stephen filled with God's grace, and with great strength,
  and he wrought miracles and great signs among the people. Then arose some
  of the unbelieving Jews, and would with their error quell the blessed
  martyr's doctrine; but they could not withstand his wisdom, nor the Holy
  Ghost, who spake through him. Then they set false witnesses, who belied
  him, and said that he spake blasphemous words of Moses and of God. The
  people were then greatly excited, and the elders, and the Jewish scribes,
  and they seized Stephen, and drew him to their council, and <!-- Page 47
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span>the false
  witnesses said of him, "This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words
  against this holy place, and God's law. We heard him say that Christ
  shall destroy this place, and change the usages which Moses hath taught
  us." Then looked on him they who sate in the council, and saw his
  countenance like the face of an angel. Then said the chief priest to the
  blessed martyr, "Is it as they say?" Then would the holy man Stephen
  rectify their unbelieving hearts with the example and remembrance of
  their forefathers, and, with all love, incline them to the way of truth.
  He began then to relate to them concerning the patriarch Abraham, how the
  God of heaven chose him for associate, and promised him, that all nations
  should be blessed in his offspring, for his obedience. In like manner, in
  a long narrative, he renewed before them the memory of the other
  patriarchs; and how Moses, through God's might, wonderfully led their
  forefathers over the Red Sea, and how they afterwards were forty days in
  the waste, daily fed with heavenly food; and how God led them to the
  Jewish country, and wholly destroyed before their sight all the heathen
  nations; and of David the great king's greatness, and of Solomon's glory,
  who the great temple raised to God. At last he said, "Ye withstand the
  Holy Ghost with stiff neck and unbelieving heart; ye are betrayers and
  murderers, and the righteous Christ ye enviously slew; ye have received a
  law by the disposition of angels, and ye have held it not." Then were the
  Jews greatly disturbed in their heart, and gnashed their teeth against
  him. But the holy Stephen was filled with the Holy Ghost, and looked
  towards heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right
  of his Father; and he said, "Behold, I see the heavens open, and the Son
  of man standing at the right hand of God." Then the Jews, crying with a
  loud voice, held their ears, and with one accord rushed on him, and
  seized him, and led him out of the city to be stoned. The false witnesses
  then laid their coats before the <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page49"></a>{49}</span>feet of a young man who was called <span
  class="sc">Saul</span>. They then begun to stone with hard stones the
  blessed Stephen; and he cried, and said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
  And he bowed his knees, crying with a loud voice, "My Lord, place not
  thou these deeds to them as sin." And he then with that word departed to
  the Almighty Saviour, whom he had seen standing high in heaven.</p>

</td><td class="anglice">
  <p>The wise Augustine spake touching this text, and inquired, why the
  holy martyr Stephen said that he saw the Son of man standing at God's
  right hand, and would not say the Son of God; when it seemed worthier of
  Christ to be called the Son of God than the Son of man? But it was
  fitting that Jesus should be so manifested in heaven, and so announced on
  earth. All the malice of the Jews arose in this, Why the Lord Christ,
  who, after the flesh, is truly the Son of man, should also be called the
  Son of God; for the holy writ hath very properly mentioned the Son of man
  standing at the right hand of God, to shame the disbelief of the Jews.
  Christ was manifested in heaven to his blessed martyr Stephen, who was
  slain by the unbelievers on earth; and the heavenly truth gave testimony
  of him, whom earthly wickedness had shamefully calumniated. Who can
  rightly be called the Son of man, save Christ only, when every man
  besides him is the son of two persons? The blessed Stephen saw Christ
  standing, because he was his support in the spiritual fight of his
  martyrdom. Verily we confess in our creed that the Lord sits at the right
  hand of his Father. A seat is befitting to a judge, and standing to one
  helping or fighting. Now our creed acknowledges Christ's seat, because he
  is the true Judge of the living and the dead: and the blessed martyr
  Stephen saw him standing, because he was his helper, as we before said.
  The death of all the chosen saints is precious in the sight of God; yet
  it seems, if any difference may be between martyrs, that he is the most
  exalted who suffered <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>{51}</span>martyrdom next to God. Now Stephen was
  ordained deacon at the hands of the apostles; but he preceded them in the
  kingdom of heaven by a triumphant death; and so he who was lower in order
  was first in suffering; and he who was a disciple in condition was the
  earliest to be a doctor in martyrdom. That death verily which Jesus
  vouchsafed to suffer for men, Stephen gave first of men to Jesus. He is
  called protomartyr, that is the first witness, because he first after
  Christ's passion suffered martyrdom. Stephen is a Greek name, which is in
  Latin, <i>Coronatus</i>, and which we express in English by,
  <i>Glory-crowned</i>, because he has the eternal crown of glory, as his
  name foretold to him. The lying witnesses, who had falsely accused him,
  begun first to stone him; because the law of Moses taught, that whosoever
  accused another to death should throw the first stone against him whom he
  had before slain with his tongue. The cruel Jews raging stoned the holy
  one, and he cried and said, "Lord, place thou not these deeds to them as
  sin."</p>

  <p>Understand now, my brethren, the great love of this blessed man. He
  was placed in death, and yet he prayed with true love for his slayers;
  and amid the falling of the stones, when any one might forget his dearest

  these deeds to them as sin." He was more afflicted on account of their
  sins than of his own wounds, more for their wickedness than his own
  death; and rightly more, seeing that eternal death followed their
  wickedness, and eternal life followed his death. Saul held the garments
  of the false witnesses, and zealously instigated their minds to the
  stoning. But Stephen with bended knees besought the Lord that he would
  redeem Saul. Stephen's prayer was heard, and Saul was redeemed. The pious

  Verily the church of God would not have had Paul as a teacher, if the
  holy martyr Stephen had not thus prayed. Behold, Paul now rejoices with
  Stephen in the kingdom of heaven; with Stephen he enjoys the brightness
  of Christ, and with him he rules. Whither Stephen preceded, stoned with
  the stones of Saul, thither Paul followed, aided by the prayers of
  Stephen. Paul is not there defiled through Stephen's murder, but Stephen
  rejoices in the fellowship of Paul, because true love rejoices in them
  both. True love overcame the cruelty of the Jews to Stephen, and the same
  love covered over the greatness of his sins in Paul, and it in both of
  them together earned the kingdom of heaven. Verily true love is the
  fountain and origin of all goodness, and noble fortitude, and the way
  that leads to heaven. He who journeys in true love cannot err nor fear:
  it directs, and shields, and leads. Through true love was the holy martyr
  rendered so courageous that he boldly reproved the disbelief of the Jews,
  and he continued tranquil amid the great stones, and benevolently prayed
  for the stoners, and, in addition thereto, entered the heavenly hall
  living, and crowned with glory.</p>

  <p>My brethren, let us in some degree imitate so great a teacher's faith,
  and so great a martyr's love. Let us love our brothers in God's church
  with such affection as that with which this martyr loved his foes. Be
  mindful what Truth itself has promised in the holy gospel, and what
  pledge it has given us. Jesus said, "If ye forgive those men who sin
  against you, then will your heavenly Father forgive you your sins: but if
  ye will not forgive, your Father will not forgive you your sins." Ye hear
  now, my brethren, that it stands, through God's grace, at our own option
  how we shall be judged before God. He said, "If ye forgive, ye shall be
  forgiven." Let no man deceive himself: verily if any one hate a man in
  this world, whatever good he may have done, <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>he loses it all; for the
  apostle Paul speaks not falsely, who says, "Though I spend all my wealth
  in food for the poor, and though I give my own body to be slain, so that
  I burn in martyrdom, if I have not true love, it profiteth me nothing."
  Concerning the same the evangelist John said, "He who loveth not his
  brother continueth in death." Again he said, "Every one who hateth his
  brother is a murderer." We are all brothers who believe in God, and we
  all say, "Pater noster qui es in c&oelig;lis," that is, "Our Father who
  art in heaven." Let no man presume on kinship without true love. Let no
  man trust in alms-deeds, or in prayers, without the aforesaid love; for
  so long as he holds black malice in his heart, he cannot in any way
  delight the merciful God. But if he desire that God be merciful to him,
  let him listen to good counsel, not from my mouth, but from that of
  Christ himself: he said, "If thou offerest thy gift at God's altar, and
  thou there rememberest that thy brother hath something against thee,
  leave forthwith the gift before the altar, and go first to thy brother,
  and reconcile thee to him, and when thou comest again to the altar, offer
  then thy gift." But if thou hast injured thy christian brother, then hath
  he something against thee, and thou shalt, according to God's teaching,
  gladden him, ere thou offerest thy gift. But if the christian man, who is
  thy brother, hath in aught done thee evil, that thou shalt mercifully
  forgive. Our spiritual gifts are our prayers, and hymn, and
  housel-hallowing, and every other gift that we offer to God, which we
  should give to God with peaceful heart and brotherly love. Now will some
  man say against this text, I cannot love my foe, whom I see daily
  bloodthirsty against me. O thou man, thou seest what thy brother hath
  done to thee, but thou seest not what thou hast done to God. When thou
  much heavier sins hast perpetrated against God, why wilt thou not forgive
  one man little offences, that the Almighty God may forgive thee great
  <!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page57"></a>{57}</span>sins? Now again thou wilt say, It is a great
  hardship for me to love my foe, and to pray for him who meditates harm
  against me. We will not gainsay that it is a great hardship; but if it is
  difficult in this world, it turns to a great reward in the one to come.
  Verily by love of thy foe thou art the friend of God, and not only art
  thou his friend, but thou art also a child of God, by the condition that
  thou love thy foe; as Christ himself hath said, "Love your enemies, do
  good to those who hate you, that ye be your Father's children, who is in
  heaven." Many hardships and contumelies any one would easily endure that
  he might be accounted the child of some powerful man, and his heir to
  transitory possessions: bear now patiently, for the everlasting honour of
  being accounted children of God, and his heirs in heavenly riches, that
  which the other would undergo for a frail matter.</p>

  <p>We tell you God's law; hold it if ye will. If we kept it in silence,
  we should not be secure. Love of Christ compels us ever to stimulate the
  good, that they continue in goodness; and we admonish the wicked that
  they may quickly turn from their wickedness. Let not the righteous be
  heedless at his beginning, nor the wicked despair through his
  unrighteousness. Let the good man dread lest he fall; the wicked take
  care that he stand. Let him who is wicked imitate the conversion of Paul;
  let him who is good persist in goodness with Stephen; for no beginning is
  praiseworthy without a good ending. All praise will be sung at the

  <p>John the Evangelist, Christ's darling, was on this day, through God's
  visitation, taken to the joy of the kingdom of heaven. He was the son of
  Christ's maternal aunt, and he loved him particularly, not so much for
  the consanguinity, as for the purity of his uncorrupted chastity. He was
  in chastity chosen to God, and he ever continued in undefiled chastity.
  It is read in historic narratives that he would marry, and Christ was
  invited to his nuptials. Then it befell that at the nuptials wine was
  wanting. Jesus then bade the serving men fill six stone vessels with pure
  water, and he with his blessing turned the water to noble wine. This is
  the first miracle that he openly wrought in his state of man. Now John
  was so stimulated by that miracle, that he forthwith left his bride in
  maidenhood, and ever afterwards followed the Lord, and was by him
  inwardly beloved, because he had withdrawn himself from fleshly lusts.
  Verily to this beloved disciple Jesus intrusted his mother, when,
  suspended on the cross, he redeemed mankind, that his pure life might
  take care of the pure virgin Mary, and that she might continue
  ministering to her sister's son.</p>

  through God's protection, went uninjured from that hot bath. Afterwards,
  when the cruel one might not suppress the preaching of the blessed
  apostle, he sent him into exile to an island that is called Patmos, that
  he there, through sharpness of hunger, might perish. But the Almighty
  Saviour did not leave his beloved apostle to <!-- Page 61 --><span

  senators; and they all unanimously resolved that all his decrees should
  be annulled. Then was Nerva, a very honourable man, chosen for emperor.
  With his consent the apostle returned with great worship, he who with

  <p>On the second day the apostle going in the street, observed where a
  philosopher was accompanying two brothers, who had turned all their
  parents' treasure into precious gems, and would crush them in the sight
  of all the people as a spectacle, in contempt as it were of worldly
  riches. It was common at that time for those who would sedulously learn
  philosophy, to change their property for gems, and break them in pieces;
  or for a wedge of gold, and throw it into the sea; lest the contemplation
  of those riches should hinder them at their study. Then the apostle
  called the philosopher Graton to him, and said, "It is foolish that any
  one should despise worldly riches for praise of men, and be condemned at
  God's doom. Vain is the medicine that cannot heal the sick; as also is
  vain the doctrine that healeth not the sins and vices of the soul. <!--
  Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>{63}</span>Verily
  my teacher, Christ, enjoined a youth who desired eternal life, in these
  words, That he should sell all his wealth, and distribute the value to
  the poor, if he would be perfect; and he should afterwards have his
  treasure in heaven, and, in addition thereto, eternal life." The
  philosopher Graton him answered, "These jewels are crushed for idle
  vaunt; but if thy teacher is the true God, join the fragments to
  soundness, that their value may benefit the poor." John then gathered the
  fragments of the jewels, and looked to heaven, thus saying, "Lord Jesus,
  to thee no thing is difficult; thou didst restore this crushed world for
  thy faithful, through sign of the holy rood; restore now these precious
  gems, by thy angels' hands, that these ignorant men may acknowledge thy
  powers, and in thee believe." Lo, then suddenly the gems became sound, so
  that even no sign of their former broken condition was seen. Then the
  philosopher Graton, together with the youths, fell forthwith at the feet
  of John, believing in God. The apostle baptized him with all his family,
  and he began openly to preach God's faith. The two brothers, Atticus and
  Eugenius, gave their gems, and distributed all their wealth to the poor,
  and followed the apostle, and a great multitude of believers also joined
  themselves to him.</p>

  <p>Then on a certain time the apostle came to the city of Pergamus, where
  the before-mentioned youths formerly dwelt, and saw their servants
  decorated with fine linen, and shining in worldly splendour. Then were
  they pierced through with the devil's darts, and sad in mind, that they
  in poverty should go with one miserable cloak, and their servants be
  shining in worldly splendour. Then perceived the apostle the diabolical
  wiles, and said, "I see that your mind and your countenance are changed,
  because ye have distributed your riches to the poor, and followed my
  Lord's doctrine: go now therefore to the wood, and hew a burthen of rods,
  and bring them to me." They did as he had commanded, and he <!-- Page 65
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>in God's name
  blessed the green rods, and they were turned to red gold. Again the
  apostle said, "Go now to the sea-strand, and fetch me pebble-stones."
  They did so, and John by God's majesty blessed them, and they were turned
  to precious gems. Then said the apostle, "Go to the smithy, and try this
  gold and these gems." They went, and came again, thus saying, "All the
  goldsmiths say that they have never before seen such pure and such red
  gold: also the jewellers say that they have never before met with such
  precious gems." Then said the apostle to them, "Take this gold and these
  gems, and go and buy landed property, seeing that ye have lost heavenly
  riches. Buy yourselves purple kirtles, that ye for a little while may
  shine as the rose, that ye may speedily fade. Be flourishing and rich for
  a season, that ye may be poor for ever. What, may not the Almighty Ruler
  so act that he make his servants powerful before the world, abounding in
  wealth, and incomparably to shine? But he has placed warfare for the
  believing souls, that they may believe in order to possess the eternal
  riches, they who for his name despise temporary possessions. Ye healed
  the sick in the name of Jesus, ye drove out devils, ye gave sight to the
  blind, and cured every disease. Behold, now this gift is withdrawn from
  you, and ye are become poor wretches, ye who were great and strong. The
  devils stood in so great awe of you, that at your behest they forsook the
  possessed demoniacs; now ye yourselves dread devils. The heavenly
  possessions are common to us all. Naked we were born, and naked we
  depart. The brightness of the sun, and the light of the moon, and of all
  the stars are common to the high and the low. Rain-showers and the
  church-door, baptism and forgiveness of sins, partaking of the housel and
  God's visitation, are common to all, poor and rich: but the unhappy
  covetous wishes to have more than suffices him, though he enjoys not
  freedom from care in his abundance. The covetous hath one body and divers
  garments; he hath one belly and a <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>thousand men's
  sustenance; but that which he, through the vice of avarice, cannot give
  to any other, he hoardeth, and knoweth not for whom, as the prophet said,
  'Vainly is every man troubled who hoardeth, and knoweth not for whom he
  gathereth.' Verily he is not lord of those possessions, when he cannot
  distribute them, but he is the slave of those possessions, when he wholly
  serveth them; and in addition thereto, diseases of his body increase, so
  that he may not enjoy food or drink. He cares night and day that his
  money be preserved; he attends greedily to his gain, his rent, his
  buildings; he bereaves the indigent, he follows his lusts and his
  pleasure; then suddenly departs he from this world, naked and charged
  with crimes, bearing with him his sins alone; therefore shall he suffer
  punishment everlasting."</p>

  <p>Behold, while the apostle was speaking this lecture, a certain widow
  bare her son to be buried, who had been married thirty days before. The
  afflicted mother, together with the mourners, wailing prostrated herself
  at the holy apostle's feet, praying that he would, in God's name, rear up
  her son, as he did the widow Drusiana. John then, pitying the grief of
  the mother and the mourners, prostrated his body on the earth, in long
  prayer, and at length rising up, again with up-raised hands prayed a long
  time. Having done thus thrice, he bade them unwrap the corpse of the
  youth, and said, "O thou youth, who through thy flesh's lust hast early
  lost thy soul; O thou youth, thou knewest not thy Creator; thou knewest
  not the Saviour of men; thou knewest not the true friend, and hast
  therefore fallen on the worst enemy. Now I have shed my tears, and
  earnestly prayed for thy sensuality, that thou mayest from death arise,
  and to these two brothers, Atticus and Eugenius, declare how great glory
  they have lost, and what punishment they have earned." On this the youth
  Stacteus arose, and fell at the feet of John, and began to chide the
  brothers who had been perverted, thus saying, "I saw the angels who had
  charge of you sadly <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page69"></a>{69}</span>weeping, and the accursed fiend rejoicing in
  your destruction. For you was the kingdom of heaven ready, and shining
  structures filled with repasts, and with eternal light: these ye have
  lost through heedlessness, and have got for yourselves dark dwellings
  filled with serpents, and with crackling flames, full of unspeakable
  torments and horrible stenches; in which groaning and howling cease not
  day nor night: pray, therefore, with inward heart, this apostle of God,
  your teacher, that he raise you from eternal perdition, as he hath raised
  me from death, and that he your souls, which are now blotted from the
  living book, lead back to God's grace and mercy."</p>

  <p>The youth then, Stacteus, who had risen from death, together with the
  brothers, prostrated himself in the footsteps of John, and the people
  with them, all unanimously praying that he would intercede with God for
  them. The apostle then commanded the two brothers that they for thirty
  days in penitence should sacrifice to God by penance, and in that space
  should earnestly pray that the golden rods might be turned again to their
  former nature, and the gems to their worthlessness. After thirty days'
  space, when they could not by their prayers restore the gold and the gems
  to their nature, they came with weeping to the apostle, thus saying,
  "Ever hast thou taught mercy, and that one should have mercy on another;
  and if one have mercy on another, how much more will God show mercy to
  and pity men, his handiwork! The sin which we have committed with
  covetous eyes, we now with weeping eyes repent." Then answered the
  apostle, "Bear the rods to the wood, and the stones to the sea-strand:
  they shall be restored to their nature." When they had done this they
  again received God's grace, so that they drove out devils, and healed the
  blind and the sick, and performed many miracles, in the Lord's name, as
  they before had done.</p>

  Matthew, Mark, Luke, wrote rather of Christ's human state. Then there
  sprung up heretics in God's church, who said that Christ was not before
  he was born of Mary. Thereupon all the diocesan bishops besought the holy
  apostle to compose the fourth book, and extinguish the audacity of the
  heretics. John then ordered a general fast of three days; and after the
  fast he was so greatly filled with the spirit of God, that he excelled
  all God's angels and all creatures with his exalted mind, and began the
  evangelical memorial with these words, "In principio erat verbum," etc.,
  that is in English, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with
  God, and the word was God; this was in the beginning with God; all things
  are made through him, and without him nothing is created." And so forth,
  in all the evangelical memorial, he made known many things concerning
  Christ's divinity, how he eternally without beginning was begotten of his
  Father, and reigneth with him in unity of the Holy Ghost, ever without
  end. He wrote few things of his human nature, because the three other
  evangelists had composed their books abundantly concerning that.</p>

  <p>It happened at a certain time, that the idolaters, who were yet
  unbelieving, said that they would force the apostle to their heathenship:
  whereupon the apostle said to the idolaters, "Go all together to God's
  church, and call all of you to your gods that, through their might, the
  church may fall down; then will I turn to your heathenship. But if the
  power of your god may not cast down the holy church, I will cast down
  your temple, through the might of the Almighty God, and I will crush your
  idol; and it shall then seem right that ye cease from your error, and
  believe in the true God, who alone is Almighty." The idolaters assented
  to this proposal, and John with kind words exhorted the people to go out
  from the devil's temple; and with clear voice cried <!-- Page 73 --><span

  within it, that this multitude may know that this idolatry is the worship

  all its idols turned to dust. On that same day twelve thousand heathens

  <p>But the chief idolater still refused with great perverseness, and said
  that he would not believe unless John drank poison, and through God's
  might overcame the deadly drink. Then said the apostle, "Though thou give
  me poison, through God's name it shall not hurt me." Then said the
  idolater Aristodemus, "Thou shalt first see another drink it, and
  instantly die, that so at least thy heart may fear the death-bearing
  drink." John answered him, "If thou wilt believe in God, I will fearless
  receive this drink." Then Aristodemus went to the prefect, and took from
  his prison two thieves, and gave them the poison before all the people,
  in the presence of John; and they immediately after the drink died. Then
  the idolater gave the venomous drink also to the apostle, and he having
  armed his mouth and all his body with the sign of the rood, and exorcised
  the poison in God's name, with bold heart drank it all. Aristodemus then
  and the people beheld the apostle three hours of the day, and saw him
  having a glad countenance, without paleness and fear: and they all cried,
  "There is one true God, whom John worshippeth." Then said the idolater to
  the apostle, "Yet I doubt; but if thou, in the name of thy God, wilt
  raise up these dead thieves, then will my heart be cleansed from every
  doubt." Then said John, "Aristodemus, take my tunic, and lay it on the
  corpses of the dead men, and say, 'The apostle of Jesus Christ hath sent
  me to you, that ye in his name may arise from death, and that every man
  may know that death and life minister to my Saviour.'" He <!-- Page 75

  apostle's command, bare his tunic, and laid it on the two dead ones, and
  they forthwith rose up whole. When the idolater saw that, he prostrated
  himself at the feet of John, and then went to the prefect, and announced
  to him those miracles with a loud voice. Then they both sought the
  apostle, praying for his compassion: whereupon the apostle enjoined them
  a fast of seven days, and afterwards baptized them; and after their
  baptism they cast down all their idols, and with the aid of their
  kinsmen, and with all art, raised a great church to God in honour of the

  <p>When the apostle was ninety-nine years old the Lord Christ appeared to
  him with the other apostles, whom he had taken from this life, and said,
  "John, come to me; it is time that thou with thy brethren shouldst feast
  at my banquet." John then arose, and went towards Jesus. But he said to
  him, "Lo, on Sunday, the day of my resurrection, thou shalt come to me:"
  and after those words the Lord returned to heaven. The apostle greatly
  rejoiced in that promise, and at sunrise early rising came to the church,
  and from cock-crowing until the third hour, taught God's law, and sang
  mass to them, and said, that the Saviour had called him to heaven on that
  day. He then ordered his grave to be dug opposite the altar, and the dust
  to be removed; and he went quick and whole into his grave, and with
  outstretched hands cried to God, "Lord Christ, I thank thee that thou
  hast invited me to thy banquet: thou knowest that with all my heart I
  have desired thee. Oft have I prayed thee that I might go to thee, but
  thou saidst that I should abide, that I might gain more people to thee.
  Thou hast preserved my body against every pollution, and thou hast ever
  illumined my soul, and hast nowhere forsaken me. Thou hast set in my

  <p>Matthew wrote, in the first book of Christ, in these words, of the
  birth-time of Jesus, and said, "When Jesus was born in the Judæan
  Bethlehem, in the days of Herod the king, behold there came from the east
  part of the earth three astrologers to the city of Jerusalem, thus
  inquiring, Where is the King of the Jewish people, who is born? Verily we
  saw his star in the east part, and we come in order that we may worship
  him. Now king Herod hearing this was greatly troubled, and all the
  citizens together with him. He then assembled all the chief bishops and
  scribes of the people, and inquired where the birthplace of Christ might
  be. They said, In the Judæan Bethlehem. Thus verily it is written by the
  prophet Micah, Ah thou Bethlehem, Judæan land, thou art in no wise
  meanest of cities among the Jewish princes: of thee shall come the Ruler
  who shall rule and govern the people of Israel. Then Herod called the
  three astrologers in separate discourse, and diligently questioned them
  at what time the star had first appeared to them, and sent them to
  Bethlehem, thus saying, Go instantly, and inquire concerning the child,
  and when ye find it, let me know, that I may worship him. After the
  king's speech the astrologers went, and lo, the star which they had seen
  in the east part glided before them, till it stood over the inn in which
  the child was staying. They saw the star and greatly rejoiced. They then
  went in, and found the child with Mary his mother, and falling down they
  worshipped him. They opened their cases of treasure and offered him
  gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. Then God warned them in a
  dream, and commanded, that they should not return to the cruel king
  Herod, but should turn through another way, and so come to their own
  country. Lo, God's angel appeared to Joseph, the child's foster-father,
  in a dream, saying, 'Arise, and take this child with the mother, and flee
  to the land of Egypt, and be there until I speak to thee again: for it
  will come to pass that Herod will devise how he may fordo the child.'
  <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page81"></a>{81}</span>Joseph then arose by night, and conveyed the
  child together with the mother to the land of Egypt, and there staid
  until Herod departed; that the prophecy might be fulfilled which of old
  thus spake of that journey, From the land of Egypt I have called my
  son."</p>

  <p>Now chroniclers say that in the meanwhile Herod was accused to the
  Roman emperor, who at that time ruled all the earth. He therefore went,
  by the emperor's command, to Rome, that he might clear himself, if he
  could. He cleared himself very cunningly, as he was so sagacious, that
  the emperor sent him back with great honour to the Jewish kingdom. When
  he came home he remembered what he had intended concerning the child, and
  saw that he had been deceived by the astrologers, and was exceedingly
  irritated. He then sent his executioners, and slew all the male children
  that were in the city of Bethlehem, and in all its boundaries, from the
  child of two years to that of one day, according to the time which he had
  inquired of the astrologers. Then was fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah,
  who thus prophesied, "A voice is heard on high, great weeping and
  wailing: Rachel wept for her children, and would not be comforted,
  because they are not."</p>

  his eternal kingdom. Blessed they were born that they might for his sake
  suffer death. Happy is their age, which could not yet acknowledge Christ,
  and might for Christ suffer. They were witnesses of Jesus, though they
  yet knew him not. They were not ripened for slaughter, yet they blessedly
  died to life. Blessed was their birth, because they found everlasting
  life at the entrance of this present life. They were snatched from their
  mothers' breasts, but they were instantly committed to the bosoms of
  angels. The wicked persecutor could not by any service so greatly favour
  those little ones, so greatly as he favoured them by the fierce hate of
  persecution. They are called blossoms of martyrs, because they were as
  blossoms springing up in the midst of the chill of infidelity, consumed,
  as it were, by the frost of persecution. Blessed are the wombs which bare
  them, and the breasts that such have sucked. Verily the mothers suffered
  through their children's martyrdom; the sword that pierced their
  children's limbs entered the hearts of the mothers, and it is needful
  that they be partakers of the eternal reward, when they were companions
  of the suffering. They were slain while little and witless, but they

  <p>The patriarch Abraham was the first man circumcised by God's command.
  Abraham spake with God, and God held converse most with him after Noah's
  flood, and said, "I am the Lord Almighty; walk before me and be perfect.
  And I will set my covenant betwixt me and thee, and I will exceedingly
  multiply thee, and thou shalt be the father of many nations. Kings shall
  spring from thee, and I will set my covenant betwixt me and thee, and thy
  offspring after thee, that I am the God of thee and of thy offspring."
  Abraham prostrated himself with all his limbs to the earth, and God said
  to him, "Hold thou my covenant, and thy offspring after thee in their
  tribes. This is my covenant, which ye shall hold betwixt me and you; that
  every male child in your tribe shall be circumcised: be that a sign
  betwixt me and you. Let every <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  circumcised, both the noble-born and the slave; and he who neglecteth
  this, his soul shall perish, because he hath disregarded my covenant. Now
  be thou henceforth called not Abram, but Abraham, because I will
  establish thee as the father of many nations. Nor be thy wife called
  Sarai, but be called Sarah; and I will bless her, and of her I will give
  thee a son whom thou shalt call Isaac; and I will set my covenant with
  him and his offspring for everlasting duration. And after this speech the
  Almighty went up." On the same day Abraham was circumcised, and all his
  household, and afterwards his son Isaac, on the eighth day from his
  birth.</p>

  <p>Abraham's name was at first spoken with five letters, 'Abram,' that is
  <i>High father</i>; but God increased his name with two letters, and
  called him Abraham, that is <i>Father of many nations</i>: for God said
  that he had appointed him for father of many nations. His wife was called
  Sarai, which is interpreted, <i>My chief</i>; but God called her
  afterwards Sarah, that is <i>Chief</i>; that she might not be exclusively
  called her family's chief, but absolutely chief; which is to be
  understood, mother of all believing women. An hundred years old was
  Abraham, and his consort ninety, before they had a child between them.
  When a child came to them, it came so much with God's providence and
  blessing, that God promised blessing to all mankind through his kin. Then
  Abraham's kin ever held God's covenant; and the leader Moses, and all the
  tribe of Israel, circumcised their children on the eighth day, and gave
  them names, until Christ was born in human nature, who established
  baptism, and changed the token of the old law to spiritual
  righteousness.</p>

  <p>It is probable that some of you know not what circumcision is. God

  that there might be some sign on their bodies to show that they believed
  in God, and commanded him to take a sharp-edged flint, and cut off a <!--

  "Whatever male child shall not be circumcised in the foreskin of his
  flesh, his soul shall perish, because he hath disregarded my covenant."
  This sign stood among God's people until Christ himself came, and he
  himself was subject to the holy law that he had established, that he
  might release those who had necessarily been subjected to the old law. He
  said that he came not to overthrow, but to fulfil the old law. Then on
  the eighth day from his birth he was bodily circumcised, as he himself
  had before taught, and thereby manifested that the old law was holy and
  good in its time for those who were obedient to it. It was usual that the
  parents should give a name to the child on the eighth day, with
  circumcision, but they durst not give any other name to Christ than what

  <p>It is not now allowed to christian men to observe circumcision bodily,
  but, nevertheless, no man is truly a christian, unless he observe
  circumcision in spiritual conduct. What does the amputation of the

  concealed from the laymen, were it not for its spiritual signification.
  To unlearned men it seems foolish to hear; but if it seems foolish <!--

  this matter ye have often heard, but to us your displeasure is more
  tolerable than the anger of Almighty God, if we announce not his
  commandments. If ye will live according to human reason, then are ye
  spiritually circumcised; but if ye will be subjected to your
  libidinousness, then will ye be as the prophet said, "Man, when he was in

  <p>Therefore has God given reason to men that they might acknowledge
  their Creator, and by observance of his commandments, merit eternal life.
  Verily the wicked man is more miserable than any beast, because the beast
  has no soul, nor will ever be quickened again, nor suffer future
  punishments. But we, who are created after God's likeness, and have an
  unperishable soul, we shall arise from death, and render to God an
  account of all our thoughts, and words, and works. Therefore we should
  not merely be circumcised in one member, but should constantly diminish
  foul libidinousness, and turn our eyes from evil seeing, and ears from
  evil hearing; our mouth from leasing speeches, hand from wicked deeds;
  our footsteps from the deadly path, our hearts from guile. If we are thus
  circumcised from sins, then will a new name be given us, as the prophet
  Isaiah said, "God will call his servants by other names." Again, the same
  prophet said, "Thou shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of God
  hath named." That new name is 'Christianus,' that is, <i>Christian</i>.
  We are all from Christ called christians, but we should adorn that
  honourable name with exalted morals, that we be not false christians. If
  we observe this spiritual circumcision in our morals, then are we of
  Abraham's kin, in true faith; as the apostle of the gentiles, Paul, said
  to <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>the faithful, "If ye are Christ's, then are
  ye of Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise." Peter the
  apostle also exhorted faithful women to humility and modesty, thus
  saying, "As Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord, whose daughters ye
  are, well doing and not fearing any affliction."</p>

  <p>We have often heard that men call this day the day of the year, as if
  this day were first in the circuit of the year; but we find no
  explanation in christian books, why this day is accounted the beginning
  of the year. The old Romans, in heathen days, begun the circuit of the
  year on this day; and the Hebrew nations on the vernal equinox; the
  Greeks on the summer solstice; and the Egyptians begun their year at
  harvest. Now our calendar begins, according to the Roman institution, on
  this day, not for any religious reason, but from old custom. Some of our
  service-books begin on the Lord's Advent; but not on that account is that
  the beginning of the year, nor is it with any reason placed on this day;
  though our calendars, in this place, repeat it. Most rightly it has been
  thought that the beginning of the year should be observed on the day that
  the Almighty Creator placed the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the
  beginning of all the seasons; that is on the day that the Hebrew people
  begin the calculation of their year; as the leader Moses has written in
  the books of laws. Verily God said to Moses concerning that month, "This
  month is the beginning of months, and it <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>is first of the months

  <p>The eighteenth day of the month that we call March, which ye call
  Hlyda, was the first day of this world. On that day God made light, and
  morning, and evening. Then three days went forth without any measure of
  times; for the heavenly bodies were not created before the fourth day. On
  the fourth day the Almighty fixed all the heavenly bodies, and the yearly
  seasons, and commanded that they should be for a sign, for days, and for
  years. Now the Hebrews begin their year on the day when all the seasons
  were appointed, that is on the fourth day of the world's creation, and
  the doctor Beda reckons, with great discretion, that that day is the
  twenty-first of March, the day which we celebrate in honour of the holy
  man Benedict, for his great excellencies. Aye, the earth also makes known
  by her plants, which then return to life, that the time at which they
  were created is the most correct beginning of the year.</p>

  <p>This day is called the Epiphany of the Lord, that is the day of God's
  manifestation. On this day Christ was manifested to the three kings, who,
  with threefold offerings, sought him from the eastern part of the world.
  Again, after a course of years, he was, at his baptism, manifested to the
  world, when the Holy Ghost, in likeness of a dove, rested upon him, and
  the voice of the Father sounded loudly from heaven, thus saying, "This is
  my beloved Son who well pleaseth me; obey him." On this day also he
  turned water to noble wine, and thereby manifested that he is the true
  Creator who could change his creatures. For these three reasons this
  festival is called the <span class="sc">Manifestation of God</span>. On
  the first day of his birth he was manifested to three shepherds in the
  Jewish country, through the announcement of the angel. On the same day he
  was made known to the three astrologers in the East, through the bright
  star: for on this day they came with <!-- Page 107 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>{107}</span>their offerings. It was
  fitting that the discreet angel should make him known to those discreet
  Jews, who knew God's law, and that he should be manifested to the
  heathens, who knew not the divine purpose, not through a voice, but by a
  sign.</p>

  teaching of the apostles, who were of the Jewish nation. For the psalmist
  wrote concerning Christ, that he is the corner-stone which joins the two
  walls together, because he united his chosen of the Jewish people and the
  faithful of the heathen, as two walls, to one church; concerning which
  Paul the apostle said, "Jesus at his advent announced peace to us who
  were far off, and peace to those who were at hand. He is our peace, who
  hath made both one, abolishing all our former enmities in himself." The
  Jews who believed in Christ were nearer to him locally, and also through
  knowledge of the old law: we were very remote, both locally and through
  ignorance; but he gathered us with one faith to the high corner-stone,
  that is to the unity of his church.</p>

  <p>We are also to know, that there were some heretics who said, that
  every man is born according to the position of the stars, and that by
  their course his destiny befalls him, and advanced in support of their
  error, that a new star sprang up when the Lord was corporally born, and
  said that that star was his destiny. Let this error depart from believing
  hearts, that there is any destiny excepting the Almighty Creator, who
  provides for every man life by his merits. Man is not created for the
  stars, but the stars are created as a light by night for men. When the
  star glided, and led the astrologers, and pointed out to them the Child's
  inn, it showed that it was Christ's creature, and rightly ministered to
  its Creator: but it was not his destiny. Again we beseech that no
  believing man defile his faith with this error. Verily Rebekah, Isaac's
  wife, brought forth twins, Jacob and Esau, at one time, so that Jacob
  held his elder brother Esau by the foot at his birth; yet were they not
  alike in character, nor in the actions of their life. Holy writ indeed
  says that God loved Jacob, and hated Esau; not by destiny, but for
  various acts. It happens very often that the queen and the slave bring
  forth at one time, and yet the prince, through his birth, grows up for
  the lofty throne, and the son of the slave continues all his life in
  servitude.</p>

  <p>We have said concerning these threefold gifts, how they apply to
  Christ: we wish also to say how they, in a moral sense, apply to us. By
  gold is wisdom betokened, as Solomon said, "A desirable gold-treasure
  lieth in the wise man's mouth." With frankincense is manifested holy
  prayer, <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page119"></a>{119}</span>concerning which the psalmist sang, "Lord,
  be my prayer sent forth like burning frankincense in thy sight." By myrrh
  is typified the mortality of our flesh, concerning which the holy
  congregation says, "My hands dropt myrrh." To the born King we bring
  gold, if we are shining in his sight with the brightness of heavenly
  wisdom. Frankincense we bring him, if we, by diligence of holy prayers,
  kindle our thoughts on the altar of our heart, so that we may, through
  heavenly desire, give forth a sweetish savour. Myrrh we offer him, if
  through continence we quell the lusts of the flesh. Myrrh, as we have
  before said, acts so that dead flesh does not easily rot. Verily the dead
  flesh rots flagitiously, when the mortal body is subservient to
  overflowing lust, as the prophet said by one, "The beasts rotted in their
  dung." Then the beasts rot in their dung, when fleshly men end their days
  in the stench of their lust. But if we offer myrrh to God spiritually,
  then will our mortal body be preserved through continence from the
  stenches of lust.</p>

  Almighty Son of God came down, when he assumed our nature, and became
  incarnate as a human being, in order that he might redeem mankind from
  the power of the devil. He was invisible and impassible in his nature;
  then he became visible in our nature, and passible. The great multitude
  which followed him betokened those faithful christians, who follow the
  Lord with the steps of their moral virtues. Verily we follow Christ's
  foot-traces, if, with good works, we imitate his examples. "Behold, there
  came a leprous man, and fell down before Jesus, thus saying, Lord, if
  thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me. Jesus <!-- Page 123 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>{123}</span>stretched forth his
  hand, and touched him, and said, I will; and be thou cleansed. Then
  immediately was his leprosy all cleansed, and he was healed."</p>

  <p>In this deed is manifested God's might, and his humility. The law of
  Moses forbade to touch any leper, but the humble Christ would not despise
  him, though he was loathsome; and also manifested that he was lord of the
  old law, and not its slave. In his might he could have healed him with
  his word, without touching; but he manifested that his touch is very
  salutary to believers. The leper was a believer, when he cried, "Lord, if
  thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me." Jesus answered, "I will; and be thou
  cleansed." Verily God's behest is act, as the psalmist said, "He said it,
  and creatures were made. He commanded, and they were created."</p>

  <p>In a spiritual sense this leper betokened all mankind, which was
  foully leprous with divers sins in the inward man; but it inclined to the
  belief of Christ, and wisely conceived that it could not receive a
  cleansing of the soul, save through the Lord, who wrought no sin, nor was
  any guile found in his mouth. Loathsome is the body of the leper with
  many ulcers and tumours, and with divers scabs; but the inward man, that
  is the soul, is much more loathsome, if it be seized with divers sins. We
  should rightly believe in Christ, that he may heal our soul from the
  ulcers of sins; and we should steadfastly implore his will to that
  fulfilment. His hand betokens his might and his incarnation. As Christ by
  the touch of his hands healed the leper, so also he redeemed us from the
  sins of our souls by the assumption of our flesh; as the prophet Isaiah
  said, "Verily he took away our diseases, and our pains he himself
  bare."</p>

  <p>The old law commanded that every leper should go to the priest, and
  that the priest should separate him from men, if he really were leprous.
  If he were not manifestly leprous, he should then, by his judgement, be
  accounted clean. If the priest accounted him leprous, and God's might
  afterwards healed him, that he should then, with a gift, thank God for
  his cleansing. So also should he, who is leprous within with deadly sins,
  go to God's priest, and open his secret to the ghostly leech, and, by his
  counsel and aid, heal by penance the wounds of his soul. Some men imagine
  that it will suffice for a complete cure, if, with compunction of heart,
  they confess their sins to God alone, and that they need not confess to
  any priest, if they cease from evil: but if their opinion were true, the
  Lord would not have sent him, whom he himself had healed, with any gift
  to the priest. For the same example he also sent Paul, whom he himself
  had spoken to from heaven, to the priest Ananias, thus saying, "Go into
  the city, and there shall be told thee what it befitteth thee to do."</p>

  <p>They are called children of God who love him more than this world; and
  those are called rich children who plant the root of their hearts in this
  present life more than in Christ: such shall be cast into darkness. The
  gospel says, "Into utter darkness." Utter darkness is the blindness of
  the body without. Inward darkness is the darkness of the mind within. He
  who in this present life is blinded within, so that he has no
  understanding, nor heed of God's commandments, he will then be blinded
  without, and deprived of every light; because he had before spent his
  life without remembrance of God. The miserable guilty ones shall suffer
  torment in everlasting fire, and yet that swart fire shall give them no
  light. Worms shall tear their bodies with fiery teeth, as Christ said in
  his gospel, "There their worm shall never die, nor their fire be
  quenched." There shall be associated in one torment, those who in life
  were united in evil deeds, so that murderers shall eternally be tortured
  together; and adulterers with adulterers, the rapacious with the
  rapacious, robbers with robbers, perjurers with perjurers, in the broad
  flame, without any ending, shall perish. There shall be weeping and
  gnashing of teeth; for their eyes shall be tormented in the great
  burning, and their teeth shall afterwards quake in the intense cold. If
  any one doubt of the universal resurrection, let him understand this
  divine saying, That there shall be a true resurrection, where there shall
  be weeping eyes and gnashing teeth.</p>

  offers he the turtle-doves in the best manner. These two birds sing not
  like other birds, but they murmur; for they betoken the groaning of holy
  men in this life, as Christ said to his apostles, "Ye will be sad in this
  life, but your sadness will be turned to everlasting bliss." And again he
  said, "Blessed are they who bewail their sins, for they shall be
  comforted."</p>

  <p>The old man Simeon, of whom we erewhile spoke, desired not that he
  might hear Christ speak, for he knew him to be the Son of God, though he,
  in his state of humanity, was yet without speech. He could have spoken,
  had he been willing; and he was as wise when he was one day old as he was
  when he was thirty years; but he would abide the time of his growth in
  human nature, as is natural in mankind. Simeon then said, "Lord, thou
  wilt let me now depart in peace from this life, for mine eyes have seen
  thy Healing One." The Healing One of whom he spake is our Saviour Christ,
  who came to heal our wounds, that is, our sins. Simeon then said, "Whom
  thou hast prepared before the sight of all people." All men saw him not
  bodily, but he is <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page145"></a>{145}</span>announced to all men, let him believe who
  will. He who believes in him, sees him now with his faith, and in the
  eternal life with his eyes. Simeon yet said, "He is a light for the
  enlightening of the gentiles, and a glory to thy people Israel." All
  these words concerning the child, Simeon spake to the heavenly Father,
  who sent him to men. He is the true light who scattered the darkness of
  this life, as he himself said in his gospel, "I am the light of all the
  world; he who followeth me shall not come into darkness, but he shall
  have the light of life." As light scatters darkness, so also love and
  faith of Christ scatter all vices and sins from our heart; and he is the
  glory and bliss of all believing people.</p>

  <p>Then the holy maiden Mary, and Joseph, the child's foster-father,
  wondered at the words which the old Simeon uttered concerning the child.
  And Simeon then gave him his blessing, and prophesied yet more concerning
  the child, and said, "This child is set for the fall of many men, and for
  the rising of many, and for a sign, and which shall be spoken against."
  So as those men who believe in Christ will be saved by his coming, so
  also those who will not believe in Christ will be doubly condemned.
  Simply they are guilty through Adam's sin, and doubly they will be
  condemned, when they deny Christ's coming, and will not believe in the
  true Saviour. Christ came for the fall of unbelieving men, and for the
  rising of the faithful; and also to every believing man was Christ's
  coming both a fall and a rising. But how? He came because he would cast
  down every evil, and rear up every good. Now he casts down vices in us,
  and rears up virtues. He casts down pride, and rears up humility. He
  casts down libidinousness, and rears up chastity. And all wickedness he
  casts down in his chosen men, and rears up all goodness. Good cannot be
  built up unless evil be previously cast down. "Christ came for a sign,
  and which shall be spoken against." His birth is a wonderful sign, <!--
  Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page147"></a>{147}</span>because he was born of a maiden, as no
  other is; and against that unbelieving men spake, and would not believe.
  And, likewise, his resurrection from death, and his ascension to heaven,
  and all the wonders which he wrought&mdash;all these were signs, and the
  unbelieving spake against them, and the faithful believed.</p>

  was not slain nor martyred bodily, but spiritually. When she saw her
  child taken, and iron nails driven through his hands and through his
  feet, and his side afterwards wounded with a spear, then was his
  suffering her suffering; and she was then more than a martyr, for her
  mind's suffering was greater than her body's would have been, had she
  been martyred. The old Simeon said not that Christ's sword should pierce
  through Mary's body, but her soul. Christ's sword is here set, as we
  said, for his passion. Though Mary believed that Christ would arise from
  death, her child's suffering went, nevertheless, very deeply into her

  <p>When Simeon had prophesied this prophecy concerning Christ, then came

  dwelling within God's temple; and came then to the child, and prophesied
  concerning him, and confessed to God." Rightly was so holy a woman worthy
  to prophesy concerning Christ, since she had so long served God in
  chastity. Behold, ye women, and understand how it is written concerning
  her. Seven years she had lived with her husband, and was afterwards
  continuing in widowhood eighty-four years; so living as the apostle
  taught. He, the apostle Paul, said, "The widow who liveth in luxuries,
  she liveth not, but she is dead." This Anna, of whom we speak, loved not
  luxuries, <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  discourses, but occupied herself in prayers. She went not wandering

  <p>There are three states which bare witness of Christ: that is
  maidenhood, and widowhood, and lawful matrimony. A maiden is the mother
  of Christ, and in maidenhood John the Baptist continued, who testified of
  Christ, and many others besides him. This Anna, of whom we before spake,
  was a widow. Zacharias, the father of John, was a married man; both he
  and his wife prophesied concerning Christ. These three states are
  agreeable to God, if men righteously live in them. Maidenhood is both in
  men and in women. Those have right maidenhood who from childhood continue
  in chastity, and despise in themselves all lust, both of body and mind,
  through God's succour. Then shall they have from God a hundredfold meed
  in the everlasting life. Widows are those who, after the death of their
  consorts, live in chastity for love of God: they shall have a sixtyfold
  meed from God for their tribulation. Those who rightly hold their
  marriage vow, and at permitted times, and for procreation of children,
  have carnal intercourse, shall have a thirtyfold meed for their
  discretion. He who will satiate his libidinousness as often as he lists,
  shall be compared with the beasts and not with men. Concerning this the
  apostle Paul taught, "Let those who have wives be as though they had
  none." For they shall atone for all their evil lusts voluntarily in this
  life, or involuntarily after this life; and they shall come afterwards to
  the everlasting life with more difficulty. Those men who are without a
  lawful consort, and run from one to other, shall have no part and no
  blessing with Christ, unless they desist and make atonement. Let us now
  resume the gospel where we previously left it.</p>

  shall be betrayed to the Gentiles, and they shall mock and scourge me,
  and afterwards slay me, and I shall arise from death on the third day.
  But his disciples knew not the meaning of these words. Then it came to
  pass that they came near to a city which is called Jericho, and there sat
  a certain blind man by the way; and when he heard the passing of the
  people with Jesus, he asked who was passing there. They said to him that
  Jesus was passing. Then he began to cry, and said, Jesus, Son of David,
  have pity on me. The men, who were going before Jesus, chided the blind
  man, that he might be silent. He cried then much louder, Jesus, Son of
  David, have pity on me. Jesus then stood, and bade them lead the blind
  man to him. When he came near Jesus asked him, What wilt thou that I
  shall do unto thee? He said, Lord, that I may see. And Jesus said to him,
  Look now: thy faith hath healed thee. And he immediately saw, and
  followed Jesus, and glorified him. Then all the people who saw that
  miracle glorified God with great fervour."</p>

  <p>The beginning of this gospel touched our Saviour's passion, though he
  did not suffer at this time; but he would from afar and long before make
  known his passion to his disciples, that they might not be too much
  terrified by his passion, when the time came that he would suffer. Their
  mind was terrified by Christ's saying, but he again cheered them by the
  words which he spake, "I will arise from death on the third day." He
  would then strengthen and confirm <!-- Page 155 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>{155}</span>their faith with
  miracles. And they came then to the place where the blind man sat by the
  way, and Christ healed him before the sight of all the multitude, to the
  end that, with that miracle, he might bring them to belief. But the
  miracles which Christ wrought manifested one thing by power, and another
  thing they betokened by mystery. He wrought those miracles indeed through
  divine power, and with those miracles confirmed the people's faith; but
  yet there was another hidden thing in those miracles, in a spiritual
  sense. The one blind man betokened all mankind, who were blinded through
  Adam's sin, and thrust from the joy of Paradise, and brought to this
  life, which is compared to a prison. Now we are shut out from the
  heavenly light, and we may not, in this life, enjoy the light eternal;
  nor know we of it more than so much as, through Christ's teaching, we
  read in books. This world, though it may sometimes seem gay, yet is no
  more like the world eternal, than is some prison to the light day. All
  mankind, as we before said, was blinded with lack of faith and error; but
  through Christ's advent we were drawn from our errors, and enlightened by
  faith. We have now the light in our mind, that is Christ's faith; and we
  have a hope of the joy of everlasting life, though we yet bodily dwell in
  our prison.</p>

  <p>The blind man sat at the city which is called Jericho. Jericho is
  interpreted and called <i>moon</i>. The moon both waxes and wanes: for a
  half month it is waxing, for a half it is waning. Now the moon betokeneth
  our mortal life and the decay of our mortality. At the one end men are
  born, at the other they depart. When Christ came to the city of Jericho,
  which betokeneth the moon, the blind man received sight. That is, when
  Christ came to our mortality, and assumed our human nature, mankind was
  enlightened, and received sight. He sat by the way; and Christ said in
  <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  life." The man who knows nothing of the eternal light is blind; but if he
  believes in Jesus, then sits he by the way. If he will not pray for the
  light eternal, then sits he blind by the way, without prayer. He who
  rightly believes in Christ, and fervently prays for his soul's
  enlightening, he sits by the way praying. Whosoever is sensible of his
  mind's blindness, let him cry with inward heart, as the blind man cried,
  "Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me."</p>

  <p>The multitude that went before Jesus chided the blind man, and bade
  him be still. The multitude betokens our evil desires and vices, which
  call to us and occupy our hearts, so that we cannot pray so fervently as
  we ought. It happens frequently when a man is desirous to withdraw from
  evil and atone for his sins, and with his whole mind turn to God, that
  his old misdeeds, which he had previously committed, will then come and
  afflict his mind, and will still his voice, that he may not cry to God.
  But what did the blind man, when the people would still him? He called so
  much the louder, until Jesus heard his voice and healed him. So should we
  do also, if the devil trouble us with manifold thoughts and temptations:
  we should call louder and louder to Jesus, that he drive the evil
  temptations from our hearts, and that he enlighten our mind with his
  grace. But if we continue praying, then may we with our cry incline Jesus
  to stand, who was before passing on, and to hear our cry, and enlighten
  our hearts with good and pure thoughts. Evil thoughts cannot harm us, if
  they are not pleasing to us; but the more the devil terrifies us with
  evil thoughts, so much the better shall we be, and dearer to God, if we
  despise the devil and all his temptations through God's assistance.</p>

  from place to place; because he is in every place through his divine
  nature. When he was passing he heard the blind man's cry; and when he

  blindness of our minds, and through his divine nature he gives us light,
  and enlightens our blindness. He said to the blind man, "What wilt thou
  that I do to thee?" Thinkest thou that he knew not what the blind man
  desired, he who could heal him? But he would that the blind man should
  pray; for he exhorts everyone very urgently to prayers: for though he
  says, in another place, "Your heavenly Father knoweth what ye require,
  before ye pray to him for anything," yet the good God desires that we
  should fervently pray to him; because by prayers is our heart stimulated

  <p>Verily it is written, "Whosoever will be a friend of this world, he
  shall be accounted a foe of God." Christ said in some place, that "The
  way is very narrow and steep which leads to the kingdom of heaven; and it
  is very wide and smooth which leads to hell-torment." The way which leads
  to the kingdom of heaven is narrow and steep, in order that we should
  with difficulty gain our country. If we desire to obtain it, we should
  love mercy, and chastity, and truth, and righteousness, and humility, and
  have true love to God and to men, and give alms according to our means,
  and be moderate in our food, and observe all other holy things. These
  things we cannot do without difficulties; but if we do them, then may we
  with those labours, through God's support, ascend the steep way which
  leads us to eternal life. The way which leads to perdition is broad and
  smooth, because wicked <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page165"></a>{165}</span>lusts bring a man to perdition. It is very
  soft to him and no labour to satiate his libidinousness and drunkenness,
  and practise covetousness and pride, and rob the weak, and do whatsoever
  he lists: but those evil practices and others such lead him without
  labour to eternal torments, unless before his end he desist from evil and
  do good. Foolish is the wayfaring man who takes the smooth way that
  misleads him, and forsakes the steep which brings him to the city. So
  also shall we be truly inconsiderate, if we love brief voluptuousness and
  transitory pleasures so greatly that they bring us to eternal torments.
  But let us take the more difficult way, that we may here for some time
  labour, in order to be eternally without labour. Easily might Christ, had
  he been willing, have continued in this life without hardships, and gone
  to his everlasting kingdom without suffering, and without death; but he
  would not. Concerning which Peter the apostle said, "Christ suffered for
  us, and gave us an example, that we should follow his footsteps;" that
  is, that we should suffer something for love of Christ, and for our sins.
  Well suffers the man, and acceptably to God, who strives against
  wickedness, and promotes goodness, as he best may. He who will suffer
  nothing in this life, shall suffer against his will in the life to
  come.</p>

  <p>It is written in the old law that no man shall worship any idol, nor
  anything, save God alone; because no creature is worthy of that honour,
  save him alone who is the Creator of all things: him only should we
  worship; he alone is true Lord and true God. We pray for their
  intercessions to holy men, that they may mediate for us with their Lord
  and our Lord; still we do not worship them as we do God, nor would they
  permit it; as the angel said to John the apostle, when he would fall at
  his feet: he said, "Do thou it not, that thou bowest to me. I am God's
  servant, as thou and thy brethren: worship God alone."</p>

  to him, and ministered to him as to their Creator. Unless the devil had

  our Saviour's meekness and his patience in this deed. He might with one

  <p>In three ways is temptation of the devil: that is in instigation, in
  pleasure, in consent. The devil instigates us to evil, but we should shun
  it, and take no pleasure in the instigation: but if our mind takes
  pleasure, then should we at least withstand, so that there be no consent
  to evil work. Instigation to evil is of the devil; but a man's mind is
  often <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  into consent; seeing that we are born of sinful flesh. Not in this wise
  was Jesus tempted; because he was born of a virgin without sin, and that
  there was nothing perverse in him. He might have been tempted by
  instigation, but no pleasure touched his mind. There was also no consent,
  because there was no pleasure; therefore was the devil's temptation all
  without, and nothing within. Uncertain came the devil to Christ, and
  uncertain he went away; seeing that Jesus manifested not his power to
  him, but overcame him patiently by the holy scriptures.</p>

  as great as angels, if ye eat of that tree." And they then believed his
  leasing, and would in their vain-glory be better than they had been

  <p>As God's law enjoins us that we should of all the things which accrue
  to us from our yearly tillage give the tithe to God, so should we
  likewise on these tithing-days tithe our body with abstinence to the
  praise of God. We should prepare ourselves in all things as God's
  servants, according to the apostle's teaching, with great patience, and
  with holy vigils, with fasts, and with chastity of mind and body; for it
  is less perilous for a Christian man to eat flesh, than at this holy tide
  to have intercourse with woman. Set aside all <!-- Page 181 --><span

  dispute, and hold this tide with peace and with true love; for no fast
  will be acceptable to God without peace. And do as God taught, break thy
  loaf, and give the second portion to an hungry man, and lead into thy
  house the poor, and miserable strangers, and comfort them with thy
  possessions. When thou seest one naked, clothe him, and despise not thy
  own flesh. The man who fasts without alms does as though he spares his
  food, and afterwards eats that which he had previously forgone in his
  abstinence; but God contemns such fasting. But if thou wilt fast to God's
  contentment, then help poor men with the portion which thou withdrawest
  from thyself, and also with more, if it be thy pleasure. Avoid idle
  discourse and foolish pleasures, and bewail your sins; for Christ said,
  "Woe to you who now laugh, ye shall mourn and weep." Again he said,
  "Blessed are they who now weep, for they shall be comforted."</p>

  <p>This miracle is very great, and deep in its significations. Often some
  one sees fair characters written, then praises he the writer and the
  characters, but knows not what they mean. He who understands the art of
  writing praises their fairness, and reads the characters, and comprehends
  their meaning. In one way we look at a picture, and in another at
  characters. Nothing more is necessary for a picture than that you see and
  praise it: but it is not enough to look at characters without, at the
  same time, reading them, and understanding their signification. So also
  it is with regard to the miracle which God wrought with the five loaves:
  it is not enough that we wonder at the miracle, or praise God on account
  of it, without also understanding its spiritual sense.</p>

  <p>Then from the beginning of mankind the Almighty God made known,
  sometimes by signs, sometimes by prophecies, that he would redeem mankind
  through him with whom he had made all creatures, through his own Son. Now
  there were very many prophecies recorded in the holy writings, before the
  Son of God assumed human nature. Some were prophesied of the blessed
  Mary. One of these prophecies is of Isaiah, who wrote, among his
  prophecies, thus saying, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bring
  forth a son, and his name shall be called Emanuel," that is interpreted
  in our <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Ezechiel the prophet saw in his prophecy a closed gate in the house of
  God, and an angel said to him, "This gate shall be opened to no man, for
  the Lord only will go in by that gate, and again go out, and it shall be
  shut for ever." That closed gate in the house of God betokened the holy
  maidenhood of the blessed Mary. The Lord, of all lords Lord, that is
  Christ, entered her womb, and through her was brought forth in human
  nature, and that gate is shut for ever; that is, Mary was a virgin before
  the birth, and a virgin at the birth, and a virgin after the birth.</p>

  <p>The beginning of our redemption we heard in this daily lecture,

  first cause of man's perdition was when the devil sent another devil, in
  likeness of a serpent, to the first-created woman Eve, for the purpose of
  deceiving her. Death and perdition befell us through a woman, and
  afterwards life and salvation came to us through a woman.</p>

  <p>"Mary was wedded to the righteous Joseph." Why would God be born of a
  wedded virgin? For a great reason, and also of necessity. The Jewish
  people, at that time, held God's law: the old law directed, that every
  woman who had a child out of lawful wedlock should be stoned. Now,
  therefore, if Mary had been unmarried, and had a child, the Jewish
  people, according to God's law, would have stoned her with stones.
  Therefore was she, by the providence of God, married to that righteous
  man, and everyone imagined that he was the child's father, but he was
  not. But when Joseph understood that Mary was with child, he was sad, and
  would not approach her, but thought that he would privily dismiss her.
  While Joseph was meditating this God's angel came to him, and commanded
  him, that he should have care both of the mother and of the child, and
  said, that the child was of no man begotten, but was of the Holy Ghost.
  Yet is the Holy Ghost not the father of Christ, but he is named to the
  accomplishment of Christ's humanity; for he is the Will and Love of the
  Father and of the Son. Now the humanity was effected through the Great
  Will, and is, nevertheless, the indivisible work of the Three. They are
  three in persons, Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost, and one God
  indivisible, in one Godhead. Joseph then, as the angel had commanded him,
  had care both of Mary and of the child, and was her witness that she was
  a virgin; and was Christ's foster-father, and with his support and
  comfort served him in everything in his human state.</p>

  Believe now, through these words, that he is true God of true God, and

  soon as he became man, and perfect God, the Son of the Almighty God, in

  the holy writ admonishes us, thus saying, "When thou art great, humble
  thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace and reward with God."
  She said to the angel, "Let it betide me according to thy word:" that is,

  his disbelief. "Now came the blessed Mary to his house, and greeted his
  wife Elizabeth, her cousin. When the woman heard the virgin's greeting,
  the child John rejoiced in his mother's womb, and the mother was filled

  "He sends for them." We are exhorted and invited to God's kingdom, but we
  are not forced. When we are invited, then are we untied; and when we are
  left to our own election, then is it as though we are sent for. It is
  God's mercy that we are untied; but if we live rightly, that will be both

  <p>Christ's passion did not take place on this day, but the four
  evangelists recorded his sufferings in four narratives: one we read now
  to-day, and the others in this week. The Jews took him on Friday evening,
  and held him that night, and on the morrow fixed him on a cross with four
  nails, and with a spear wounded him. And then about the ninth hour, when
  he departed, there came two believing men, Joseph and Nicodemus, and
  buried his corpse before evening in a new tomb, enwrapt in precious
  garments. And his corpse lay in the sepulchre the Saturday night and
  Sunday night; and the Divinity was during that while in hell, and bound
  the old devil, and took from him Adam, the first-created man, and his
  wife Eve, and all those of their race who had before given pleasure to
  God. Then was the devil sensible of the hook which he had before greedily
  swallowed. And Christ arose from death on the Easter-Sunday, which will
  now be in seven days, of which it is more fitting then to speak more
  fully than it is now: but let us now speak of the dignity of this
  day.</p>

  <p>The custom exists in God's church, by its doctors established, that
  everywhere in God's congregation the priest should bless palm-twigs on
  this day, and distribute them so blessed to the people; and God's
  servants should then sing the hymn which the Jewish people sang before
  Christ, when he was approaching to his passion. We imitate the faithful
  of that people with this deed, for they bare palm-twigs with hymn before
  Jesus. Now we should hold our palm until the singer begins the
  offering-song, and then offer to God the palm for its betokening. Palm
  betokens victory. Victorious was Christ when he overcame the great devil
  and rescued us: and we should also be victorious through God's might, so
  that we overcome our evil practices, and all sins, and the devil, and
  adorn ourselves with good works, and at the end of our life deliver the
  palm to God, that is, our victory, and thank him fervently, that we,
  through his succour, have overcome the devil, so that he could not
  deceive us.</p>

  <p>My dearest brothers, ye have heard that the holy women, who followed
  the Lord in life, came with precious ointment to his sepulchre, and him
  whom they had loved in life they would when dead serve with human
  devotion. But this deed <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page223"></a>{223}</span>betokens something to be done in God's
  church. We who believe in the resurrection of Christ come assuredly to
  his sepulchre with precious ointment, if we are filled with the breath of
  holy virtues, and if we with the fame of good works seek our Lord. The
  women who brought the ointment saw angels; for they see the heavenly
  angels, who with the breath of good works yearn after the upward journey.
  The angel rolled the lid from the tomb; not that he would make way for
  Christ's departure, but he would manifest to men that he was risen. He
  who came mortal to this world, born of the closed womb of the virgin, he,
  without doubt, might, when he arose immortal, though in a closed tomb,
  depart from the world. The angel sat on the right side of the sepulchre.
  The right hand betokens the eternal life, and the left this present life.
  Rightly sat the angel on the right hand, for he manifested that Jesus had
  surmounted the corruptions of this present life, and was then dwelling
  immortal in eternity. The messenger was clad in a shining garment,
  because he announced the happiness of this festival-tide, and our
  glories. But we ask, ours or the angels? We say verily, both ours and
  theirs. The resurrection of Jesus is our festival-tide, for by his
  resurrection he led us to the immortality for which we were created. His
  resurrection was bliss to the angels, because God fills up their number
  when he brings us to heaven.</p>

  <p>The angel cheered the women, thus saying, "Be ye not afraid:" as if he
  had said thus, Let those fear who love not the advent of angels; let
  those be terrified who are beset with fleshly lusts, and have no joy in
  the host of angels. Why fear ye, ye who see your companions? "His
  countenance was like lightning, and his raiment as white as snow." Verily
  in lightning is terror, and in snow the mildness of brightness. Rightly
  was the messenger of Christ's resurrection so figured; for when he
  himself shall come to the great doom, he will be very awful to the
  sinful, and very mild <!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  he is risen: he is not here." He was not then bodily in the sepulchre,
  who is everywhere through his divine power. There lay the garment behind
  in which he had been wrapt, for he recked not of an earthly garment,
  after he had arisen from death. Though a dead man be wrapt in a garment,
  that garment does not the sooner rise again with the man, but he will be
  clad with the heavenly garment after his resurrection.</p>

  from passion to resurrection, from death to life, from torment to glory.
  And if we pass from sins to holy virtues, then may we see Jesus after our
  passage from this life. For there are two lives: the one we know, the
  other was unknown to us before Christ's advent. The one life is mortal,
  the other immortal. But Jesus came and assumed the one life, and made
  manifest the other. The one life he manifested by his death, and the
  other by his resurrection. If he to us mortal men had promised
  resurrection and life eternal, and yet had not been willing to manifest
  them in himself, who would have believed in his promises? But when he
  would become man, then he also voluntarily humbled himself to death, and

  great host. The evangelist Matthew wrote in the book of Christ, that many
  holy men, who had died in the old law, arose with Christ; and all wise
  doctors have said that they have effected their resurrection to eternal
  life, as we all shall do at the end of this world. Those doctors said,

  gates, and bare them up on a hill, in derision of his foes. The strong
  Samson betokened Christ, the city of Gaza betokened hell, and the
  Philistines were a token of the Jewish people, who beset the sepulchre of
  Christ. But Samson would not go empty-handed from the city, but he <!--

  and delivered Adam, and Eve, and his chosen of their kin, and joyfully
  from death arose, and they with him, and ascended to heaven. The wicked
  he left behind to eternal torments. And now is the gate of hell shut to
  righteous men, and ever open to the unrighteous.</p>

  <p>Unhappy was the Jewish people, that they were so unbelieving. All
  creatures acknowledged their Creator, save only the Jews. Heaven
  acknowledged the birth of Christ; for when he was born a new star was
  seen. The sea acknowledged Christ, when he went with dry feet on its
  waves. Earth acknowledged him, when it all trembled at Christ's
  resurrection. The sun acknowledged him, when it was darkened at Christ's
  passion from mid-day to the ninth hour. The stones acknowledged him, when
  they burst asunder at their Creator's departure. Hell acknowledged
  Christ, when it let forth its captives, through the harrowing of Jesus.
  And yet the hardhearted Jews, through all these signs, would not incline
  with faith to the merciful Jesus, who will help all men who believe in
  him. But let us believe that God the Father was ever without beginning,
  and that the Son was ever begotten of the Father; for he is the Wisdom
  and Power through which the Father hath created all creatures; and they
  were all quickened by the Holy Ghost who is the Will and Love of the
  Father and of the Son; these three one God indivisible, existing in one
  Godhead, all equally powerful; for whatsoever is less and less powerful,
  that is not God. But the Father sent the Son for our redemption, and he
  alone assumed human nature, and suffered death of his own will, and arose
  from death on this day, and ascended to heaven on the fortieth day after
  his resurrection, before the sight of many men, and ruleth with the
  Almighty Father and the Holy Ghost, now and ever to eternity. Amen.</p>

  <p>Christ blew on the apostles, and said, "Receive the Holy Ghost." Twice
  came the Holy Ghost over the apostles; once now, and again another time
  at Christ's ascension. Christ blew the Holy Ghost over the apostles,
  while yet continuing on earth, for a token that every christian man
  should love his neighbour as himself. Again, after he had ascended to
  heaven, he sent the Holy Ghost in semblance of fire over the apostles, to
  the end that we should love God above all other things. The Holy Ghost is
  one, though he came twice over the apostles. So there is also one love,
  and two commandments, that we should love God and men. But we should
  learn in men how we may come to the love of God, as John the apostle
  said, "He who loveth not his brother, whom he seeth, how can he love God,
  whom he seeth not bodily?" Before that time the Holy Ghost was dwelling
  in the apostles, but they were not stimulated to that degree, that they
  could boldly preach God's faith, as they could afterwards, through the
  grace of the Holy Ghost. They sat, for fear of the Jewish people, shut in
  a house; but after they were filled with the Holy Ghost, they were so
  encouraged, and so bold, that they freely proclaimed the name of God to
  fierce and bloodthirsty kings.</p>

  <p>Christ said to the apostles, "Those men's sins which ye forgive, they
  shall be forgiven; and those from whom ye withdraw forgiveness, from them
  it shall be withdrawn." This power Christ gave to the apostles and to all
  bishops, if they righteously hold it. But if the bishop act by his own
  will, <!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page235"></a>{235}</span>and will bind the innocent, and loose the
  guilty, then loses he the power which God gave him. To those men he shall
  grant forgiveness of sins, whom he sees that they are stimulated by God's
  grace, and to those he shall be obdurate who have no repentance of their
  misdeeds. Christ raised from death the stinking Lazarus, and when he was
  quickened, he said to his disciples, "Loose his bands, that he may go."
  They loosed the bands of the requickened man, whom Christ had raised to
  life. Therefore should our teachers unbind from their sins those whom
  Christ quickens by stimulation. Every sinful man who conceals his sins,
  lies dead in the sepulchre; but if he confess his sins through
  stimulation, then he goes from the sepulchre, as Lazarus did, when Christ
  bade him arise: then shall the teacher unbind him from the eternal
  punishment, as the apostles bodily unbound Lazarus. But the layman shall
  stand in awe of the bishop's word, though he be guiltless; lest he become
  guilty through pride.</p>

  <p>It happened to the apostle Thomas not unprovidentially, that he was
  unbelieving of Christ's resurrection, but it happened by the providence
  of God; for through his touching we are believing. Of greater benefit to
  us was his doubt than the faith of the other apostles; for when he was
  brought to belief by that touching, doubt was thereby taken from us.
  Easily might Christ have arisen from death without scars, but he held the
  scars, because he would thereby confirm the doubtful. He said to Thomas,
  "Thou believest, because thou hast seen me." He saw the body and the
  scars, and he believed that he was God, who had raised the body from
  death. Greatly gladden us the words which here follow, "Blessed are they
  who have not seen me, and yet believe in me." By that saying are
  betokened all those who have not seen Christ in the body, and,
  nevertheless, hold him in their mind through faith. For he believes in
  God, who by works practises that which he believes. He who acknowledges
  that <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Christ is good by nature, and in sooth there is nothing good, save God
  only. If any creature is good, then is its goodness of the Creator, who
  is supremely good. He said, "The good shepherd giveth his own life for
  his sheep." Our Redeemer is the good shepherd, and we christian men are
  his sheep, and he gave his own life for our redemption. He did as he
  exhorted, and he thereby manifested what he enjoined. A good shepherd was
  Peter, and good was Paul, and good were the apostles, who gave their

  <p>Saint Augustine expounded this gospel, and said, that the night

  ignorance. Now therefore should everyone arise from that ignorance, and
  go to his friend, that is, he should incline to Christ with all fervour,
  and pray for the three loaves, that is, belief in the Holy Trinity. The
  Almighty Father is God, and his Son is Almighty God, and the Holy Ghost
  is Almighty God; not three Gods, but they all one Almighty God
  indivisible. When thou comest to those three loaves, that is, to an
  understanding of the Holy Trinity, then hast thou, in that belief, life
  and food for thy soul, and mayest therewith feed another stranger also,
  that is, thou mayest teach the faith to another friend who shall ask it
  of thee. He said a 'stranger,' because we are all strangers in this life,
  and our country is not here; but we are here as wayfaring men; one comes,
  another goes; this is born, the other departs and yields up his seat to
  him. Now therefore should everyone desire faith in the Holy Trinity, for

  <p>We will again speak more concerning faith, because the exposition of
  this gospel has a good deduction. The master of the family, who was gone
  to rest with his children, is Christ, who sits in heaven with his
  apostles, and with martyrs, and with all the saints whom he fetched in
  this life. We should call to Christ, and pray for the three loaves.
  Though he do not forthwith grant them to us, we should not on that
  account desist from prayer. He delays, and yet will give. He delays, that
  we may be desirous, and dearly hold the grace of God. Whatsoever a man
  gets easily is not so precious as that which is gotten with difficulty.
  Jesus said, "If he continue knocking, the master of the family will
  arise, because of the other's importunity, and grant him what he asks,
  not for friendship, but for his clamour." He said, "Not for friendship,"
  because no man were worthy either of that faith, or of eternal life, if
  God's mercy were not the <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page251"></a>{251}</span>greater towards mankind. We should knock,
  and call to Christ, because he will give to us, as he himself said, "Ask,
  and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it
  shall be opened to you." To everyone who fervently asks, and ceases not
  from prayer, God will grant everlasting life.</p>

  <p>He then said another parable. "What father will give his child a
  stone, if he ask for bread? or a serpent, if he ask for a fish? or a
  scorpion, if he ask for an egg?" God is our Father through his mercy, and
  the fish betokens faith, and the egg holy hope, the bread true love.
  These three things God gives to his chosen; for no man can have God's
  kingdom, unless he have these three things. He must rightly believe, and
  have hope in God, and true love to God and to men, if he will come to
  God's kingdom. The fish betokens faith, because its nature is, that the
  more it is tossed by the waves, the stronger it is, and the more
  vigorously it strikes. In like manner the believing man, the more he is
  afflicted for his faith, the stronger will be his faith, wherever it is
  sound. If it sink under persecution, it is then not faith, but is
  hypocrisy. The egg betokens hope, seeing that birds teem not like other
  animals, but first it is an egg, and the mother then with hope cherishes
  the egg to a young bird. In like manner our hope comes not yet to that
  which it hopes, but is, as it were, an egg. When it has that which is
  promised it, it is a bird. Bread betokens true love, which of all virtues
  is greatest, as bread is of all food the principal. Faith is a great
  virtue, and a great virtue is true hope; yet love excels them, forasmuch
  as it is ever to eternity, and the other two will end. We now believe in
  God, and we hope in him: but after we come to his kingdom, as he has
  promised us, then will faith be ended, for we shall then see what we now
  believe. Our hope will also be ended, because we shall be in possession
  of what we had previously hoped for; but love will never decay: therefore
  is it the most excellent of them.</p>

  <p>The serpent is placed in the gospel in opposition to the fish. In a
  serpent's form the devil deceived Adam; and he is now ever striving
  against our faith: but our protection is in the hand of our Father. The
  scorpion, which is set in opposition to the egg, is venomous, and stings
  with its tail to death. Those things which we see in this life are
  perishable; those which we see not, and which are promised to us are
  eternal: stretch thereto thy hope, and wait until thou have them. Look
  not behind; dread the scorpion which envenoms with its tail. The man
  looks behind, who despairs of God's mercy; then is his hope envenomed by
  the scorpion's tail. But we should both in difficulties, and in chances
  and in mischances, say as the prophet said, "I will praise the Lord at
  every time." Betide us good in body, betide us evil, we ought ever to
  thank God, and bless his name; then will our hope be preserved from the
  scorpion's sting.</p>

  <p>Let him who desires to be good call to him who ever is good, that he
  make him good. A man has gold, that is good in its kind: he has land and
  riches, they are good. But the man is not good through these things,
  unless he do good with them, as the prophet said, "He distributed his
  wealth, and divided it among the poor, and his righteousness continueth
  for ever." He diminished his money, and increased his righteousness. He
  diminished that which he must leave, and that will be increased which he
  shall have to eternity. Thou praisest the merchant who gets gold for
  lead, and wilt not praise him who gets righteousness and the kingdom of
  heaven for perishable money. The rich and the poor are wayfarers in this
  world. The rich now bears the heavy burthen of his treasures, and the
  poor goes empty. The rich bears more provisions for his journey than he
  requires, the other bears an empty scrip. Therefore should the rich share
  his burthen with the poor; then will he lessen the burthen of his sins,
  and help the poor. We are all God's poor; let us therefore acknowledge
  the poor who ask of us, that God <!-- Page 257 --><span

  when we ask our needs of him. Who are those that ask of us? Men poor, and
  feeble, and mortal. Of whom ask they? Of men poor, and feeble, and
  mortal. Except the possessions, alike are those who ask and those of whom
  they ask. How canst thou for shame ask anything of God, if thou refuse to
  thy fellow that which thou canst most easily grant him? But the rich
  looks on his purple garments, and says, 'The wretch with his rags is not
  my fellow.' But the apostle Paul beards him with these words, "We brought
  nothing to this world, nor may we take with us anything hence."</p>

  <p>God, the Father Almighty, has one Son naturally, and many adoptively.
  Christ is the Son of God, seeing that the Father begot him of himself
  without any mother. The Father has no body, nor begot he his Son in that
  wise which men do: but his Wisdom, with which he wrought all creatures,
  is his Son, who is ever of the Father and with the Father, God of God, as
  mighty as the Father. We men are children of God, because he made us; and
  afterwards, when we were undone, <!-- Page 261 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>{261}</span>he sent his own Son for
  our redemption. Now are we children of God, and Christ is our brother, if
  we will duly obey the Father, and with all our mind worship him. Christ
  is our head, and we are his limbs: he is invested with our humanity, and
  he has our body, which he received of the holy maiden Mary; therefore may
  we manifestly cry to him, as to our brother, if we so observe our
  brotherhood as he has taught us; that is, that we should not allow the
  devil with any evil practices to seduce us from the brotherhood of
  Christ.</p>

  <p>Verily the man who imitates the devil is a child of the devil, not by
  nature nor by creation, but by that imitation and evil deserts. And the
  man who makes himself acceptable to God is a child of God, not naturally,
  but by creation and by good deserts, as Christ said in his gospel, "He
  who doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and
  my mother, and my sister." Now therefore all christian men, whether high
  or low, noble or ignoble, and the lord, and the slave, are all brothers,
  and have all one Father in heaven. The wealthy is not better on that
  account than the needy. As boldly may the slave call God his Father as
  the king. We all are alike before God, unless any one excel another in
  good works. The rich for his wealth is not to despise the poor; for the
  poor is before God often better than the rich. God is our Father,
  therefore should we all be brothers in God, and hold the brotherly bond
  unbroken; that is, true peace, so that each of us love other as himself,
  and command to no one that which he would not another should command to
  him. He who observes this is a child of God, and Christ, and all holy
  persons who thrive to God, are his brothers and his sisters.</p>

  And again, the holy gospel says thus concerning him, "Heaven is his

  because from thence the heaven rises; not as though his dwelling be
  particularly in the east part, and that he forsakes the west or other
  parts, who is everywhere present, not through the space of the place, but
  by the presence of his majesty. When we turn our face to the east part,
  where the heaven rises, which rises over all bodily things, then should
  our mind be thereby admonished that it turn to the highest and first
  nature, that is, God. We should also know that the sinful is called
  earth, and the righteous is called heaven; for in righteous men is a
  dwelling-place of God, and the good man is a temple of the Holy Ghost. So
  also, on the other hand, the wicked man is a temple of the devil, and an

  What is the kingdom that he shall deliver to his Father, but those holy
  persons, both men and women, which he redeemed from hell-torment by his

  ghostly bread to our soul. The ghostly bread is the commandment of God,
  on which we should daily meditate, and with works fulfil; for as <!--
  Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>{267}</span>the
  body lives by bodily meats, so shall the soul live by the precepts of
  God, and by ghostly meditations. The body quickly wastes away and decays,
  if its sustenance is withdrawn from it; in like manner the soul perishes,
  if it has not ghostly sustenance, that is, God's commandments, on which
  it shall thrive and be cherished. The ghostly bread is also the holy
  housel, with which we confirm our belief; and through partaking of the
  holy housel our sins will be forgiven us, and we shall be strengthened
  against the temptations of the devil. Therefore should we frequently
  cleanse and confirm our soul with ghostly refection. Yet may not he who
  is polluted with deadly sins dare to partake of God's housel, unless he
  first atone for his sins: if he do otherwise, he will partake of it to
  his own injury. The bread, as we said, betokens three things. One is
  sustenance of the body; the second, of the soul; the third is the
  partaking of the holy housel. For these three things we should pray daily
  to the Lord.</p>

  the great love of God, forgive those men who trespass against us, that
  God Almighty may forgive us our sins. But if we will not forgive the
  little trespasses of those men who have angered us, then will not God
  forgive us our great and many sins: as Christ himself said, "When ye
  stand at your prayers, forgive whatever ye have in your mind against any
  man, and your Father, which is in heaven, will forgive you your sins. But
  if ye will not, with inward heart, forgive those who anger you, then your
  Father, which is in heaven, will not forgive you your sins; but he will

  your trespasses, until ye <!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The sixth prayer is, "Et ne nos inducas in tentationem:" that is,
  "Permit not, thou, O God, that we be led into temptation." One thing is
  temptation, another thing is trial. God tempts no man, but, nevertheless,
  no man comes to the kingdom of God, unless he has been tried: therefore
  we should not pray that God try us not, but we should pray to God to
  shield us, so that we sink not under trial. The devil may try every man,
  whether he be aught or naught; whether he love God with inward heart, or
  act with hypocrisy. As a man tries gold in the fire, so God tries the
  mind of man in divers trials, whether he be steadfast. God knows full
  well, how it befalls in trial; but yet a man will have no great honour,
  unless he have been tried. By trial he shall flourish, if he withstand
  temptations. If he fall, let him rise again: that is, if he sin, let him
  earnestly atone for it, and cease therefrom afterwards; for no atonement
  will avail, if there be not cessation. The man who frequently sins and
  frequently atones, angers God; and the more he sins the more he will be
  subject to the devil, and God will then forsake him, and he will go as
  the devil shall direct him, as a shattered ship at sea, which goes as the
  wind drives it. The good man the more he is tried the more cheerful he
  will be, and the nearer to God, until with full honour he shall go from
  this life to the life eternal. And the evil man, the oftener he sinks
  under trial, the more wicked he will be, and the nearer to the devil,
  until he goes from this life to eternal torment, if he would not cease
  previously, when he could and might. God therefore often awaits the evil
  man, and leaves him time, that he may cease from his wicked deeds, and
  before his end turn his mind to God, if he will. But if he will not, that
  he be, <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  thrust into the hand of the devil. Therefore is it now better for
  christian men, that with hardships and toil they earn the everlasting
  kingdom and eternal bliss with God and with all his saints, than that
  they by softness and evil lusts earn eternal tortures with all the devils
  in hell-torment.</p>

  <p>The seventh prayer is, "Sed libera nos a malo:" that is, "But deliver
  us from evil:" deliver us from the devil and from all his wiles. God
  loves us, and the devil hates us. God feeds and comforts us, and the
  devil will slay us if he may; but he will be prevented through the
  protection of God, if we will not fordo ourselves with evil practices.
  Therefore should we eschew and despise the vicious devil with all his
  devices, for there behoves him nothing for us, and we should love and
  follow our Lord, who will lead us to everlasting life.</p>

  the eyes lead the feet, and the hands prepare the sustenance. Soon will
  the head lie down, if the feet bear it not; and soon will all the limbs

  <p>Let us now hear concerning the Holy Ghost, what he is. He is the Will
  and the true Love of the Father and of the Son, through whom all things
  are quickened and preserved, concerning whom it is thus said, "The Spirit
  of God filleth all the circumference of earth, and he holdeth all things,
  and he hath knowledge of every speech." He is not made, nor created, nor
  begotten, but he is proceeding, that is going from, the Father and from
  the Son, with whom he is equal and coeternal. The Holy Ghost is not a
  son, for he is not begotten, but he proceeds from the Father and from the
  Son; for he is the Will and Love of them both. Christ spake of him thus
  in his gospel, "The Spirit of comfort whom I will send unto you, the
  Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from my Father, will bear testimony

  the right faith also teaches us, that we should believe in the Holy
  Ghost: he is the quickening God, who proceeds from the Father and from
  the Son. How proceeds he from him? The Son is the Wisdom of the Father,
  ever of the Father; and the Holy Ghost is the Will of them both, ever of
  them both. There is therefore one Father, who is ever Father; and one
  Son, who is ever Son; and one Holy Ghost, who is ever Holy Ghost.</p>

  He said, "Let us make man in our own likeness." And he then made Adam in

  the soul, not in the body. The soul of man has in its nature a likeness
  to the Holy Trinity; for it has in it three things, these are memory, and
  understanding, and will. By the memory a man thinks on the things which
  he has heard, or seen, or learned. By the understanding he comprehends
  all the things which he hears or sees. Of the will come thoughts, and
  words, and works, both evil and good. There is one soul, and one life,

  they are ever together. Yet is none of these three the soul, but the soul

  through the will it wills whatsoever it likes; and it is, nevertheless,
  one soul and one life. It has therefore God's likeness in itself, because
  it has three things in it inseparably working. Yet is the man one man,

  <p>There was a heretic called Arius, who disputed with a bishop who was
  named Alexander, a wise and orthodox man. The heretic said, that Christ
  the Son of God could not be equal to his Father, nor so mighty as he; and
  said, that the Father was before the Son, and took example from men, how
  every son is younger than his father in this life. Then said the holy
  bishop Alexander in opposition to him, "God was ever, and ever was his
  Wisdom of him begotten, and the Wisdom is his Son, as mighty as his
  Father." Then the heretic got the emperor's support to his heresy, and
  proclaimed a synod against the bishop, and would bend all the people to
  his heresies. Then the bishop watched one night in God's church, and
  cried to his Lord, and thus said, "Thou Almighty God, judge right
  judgement between me and Arius." On the morrow they came to the synod.
  The heretic then said to his companions, that he would go forth for his
  need. When he came to the place and sat, all his entrails came out, while
  he was sitting, and he sat there dead. Thus God manifested that he was as

  therefore perish. For our redemption Christ permitted them to slay him.

  us, but that seemed to him unjust. But the devil undid himself, when he

  many miracles. First Christ by himself healed dumb and deaf, halt and
  blind, mad and leprous, and raised the dead to life: after, by his
  apostles and other holy men, he wrought the same miracles. Now also in
  our time, everywhere where holy men rest, at their dead bones God works
  many miracles, because he will with those miracles confirm people's

  doubts from our hearts. Jesus then reproved his disciples for their
  doubt, when he would bodily leave them, that they might be mindful of the
  words which he said to them on his way. He said, "Go over all the world,
  and preach the gospel to every creature." The gospel is for us to hear
  and exceedingly loving, that we may avoid hell-torment and cruel tortures
  through the incarnation of Jesus, and come to the host of angels through
  his humility. He said, "Preach to every creature:" but by that name is
  man alone betokened. Stones are creatures, but they have no life, nor
  have they sense. Grass and trees live without feeling; they live not by a
  soul, but by their greenness. Beasts live and have feeling without
  reason; they have no reason, because they are soulless. Angels live, and
  have sense, and use reason. Now man has something of all creatures. He
  has in common with the stones, that he is existing; he has in common with
  the trees, that he lives; with the beasts, that he has sense; with
  angels, that he understands. Man is therefore called 'every creature,'
  because he has something in common with every creature. The gospel is
  preached to every creature, when it is preached to man alone; for all
  earthly things are created for man alone, and they all have some likeness
  to man, as we before said.</p>

  "He who saith that he knoweth God, and holdeth not his commandments, is a
  liar." Again, the apostle James says, "The faith which is without good
  works is dead." Again, he said, "What profiteth it thee that thou have
  faith, if thou hast not good works? Faith <!-- Page 305 --><span

  cried, and said, "Thou art the Son of God, therefore thou art come that
  thou mightest fordo us." The man who will not believe in God, nor has any
  awe of God, is worse than a devil. He who believes, and has awe, and,

  these signs was the heathen folk inclined to faith. The man who plants
  trees or herbs, waters them so long until they have taken root; when they
  are growing he ceases from watering: so also the Almighty God so long
  showed his miracles to the heathen folk, until they were believing: when
  faith had sprung up over all the world, then miracles ceased. But,
  nevertheless, God's church still works daily the same miracles
  spiritually which the apostles then wrought bodily. When the priest
  christens the child, then casts he out the devil from that child; for
  every heathen man is the devil's, but through the holy baptism he is
  God's, <!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  tongues. He who corrects thoughtlessness or impatience, and stills the
  bitterness of his heart, drives away serpents, for he extinguishes the
  evilnesses of his mind. He who is allured to fornication, but yet is not
  induced to its accomplishment, drinks a deadly drink, but it shall not
  hurt him, if with prayers he flees to God. If any-one be weakened in his

  <p>The spiritual miracles are greater than the bodily ones were, for
  these miracles heal a man's soul, which is eternal, but the former signs
  healed the mortal body. The former miracles were wrought both by good men
  and by evil. Judas, who betrayed Christ, was evil, though he had
  previously wrought miracles in the name of God. Of such men Christ in
  another place said, "I say unto you, many will say to me on that great

  devils out of mad men, and have performed great miracles in thy name?

  common to the good and to the evil, but love those signs which are
  exclusively good men's, which are the signs of true love and of piety.
  The evil has not true love, nor is the good devoid of it. These signs are
  mysterious and not perilous, and they have so much the greater reward
  with God as their glory is less with men. The Omnipotent Lord, after
  these words, was taken to heaven, and sits on the right hand of his

  tide was then appointed to the people for Easter-tide, because God had
  saved them from their foes, and destroyed their persecutors. Then fifty

  resurrection our Easter-tide, because he redeemed us from the thraldom of

  in this world: one is that which was without law; the second is that
  which was under the law; the third is now after the advent of Christ.
  This period is called 'under God's grace.' We are not without law, nor
  may we hold bodily the law of Moses, but God's grace directs us to his
  will, if we be mindful of Christ's commandments and of the precepts of
  the apostles.</p>

  <p>It is related in this epistolary lesson, how the Holy Ghost on this
  day came to the faithful company of Christ's followers. Luke the
  Evangelist wrote in the book 'The Acts of the Apostles,' that "the holy
  company was living unanimously in prayers on an upper floor, after
  Christ's ascension, awaiting his behest; when, on this day, which is
  called Pentecost, there came suddenly a great sound from heaven, and
  filled all the upper flooring with fire, and there appeared above each of
  them as it were fiery tongues, and they were then all filled with the
  Holy Ghost, and begun to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy
  Ghost taught them. Then there were gathered within the city of Jerusalem
  pious men of every nation dwelling under heaven; and the apostles spake
  to the gathering of people, and every of them recognized his own
  tongue."</p>

  <p>"Then was the multitude greatly amazed, and with wonder said, Lo, are
  not these which here speak Galileans? And each of us hath heard how they
  speak in our tongues, in which we were born! We have heard them declare
  the glories of God in our tongues. Lo, what should this be? Then said the
  Jews in mockery, These men are drunken with new wine. But Peter answered,
  It is the third hour; how might we at this time be drunken? But the
  saying of the prophet Joel is now fulfilled. God spake through the
  prophet's mouth, that he would send his spirit over human flesh, and the
  children of men shall prophesy, and I will give my foretokens from heaven
  above, and my signs on earth beneath. For know ye that Christ arose from
  death, and in our sight ascended to heaven, and sitteth on his Father's
  right, as David had prophesied concerning him, thus saying, The Lord said
  unto my Lord, Sit on my right until I lay thy foes under thy footstool.
  When the people heard this they were stimulated, and said to the
  apostles, Alas! what have we to do? Then Peter answered, Repent of your
  sins, and receive baptism in the name of Christ, and your sins shall be
  blotted out, and ye <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  received his doctrine, and there submitted to baptism on that day three

  <p>Ye heard a little before, in this lesson, that the Holy Ghost came
  over the apostles as fiery tongues, and gave them knowledge of all
  languages; for the humble company merited of God that which long of yore
  the proud host had lost. It happened after Noah's flood, that giants
  would raise up a city, and a tower so high, that its roof should ascend
  to heaven. There was then one language among all mankind, and the work
  was begun against the will of God. God therefore scattered them, so that
  he gave to each of the workmen an unknown language, and not one of them
  could understand another's speech. They then ceased from the building,
  and went divers ways over all the world; and there were afterwards as
  many languages as there were workmen. Now again, on this day, through the
  advent of the Holy Ghost, all languages became united and concordant; for
  all the holy company of Christ's followers were speaking in all
  languages; and also, what was more wonderful, when one of them preached
  in one tongue, it seemed to everyone who heard the preaching as though he
  spake in his language, whether they were Hebrews, or Greeks, or Romans,
  or Egyptians, or of whatsoever nation they might be who heard that
  doctrine. In this fellowship their humility gained them this power, and
  the pride of the giants gained shame.</p>

  semblance of a dove? Why over the followers of Christ in likeness of

  who would have been saved? But he would not by his advent condemn the
  sinful, but would gather them to his kingdom. He would first with
  gentleness direct us, that he might afterwards preserve us at his
  judgement. Therefore was the Holy Ghost seen in likeness of a dove above
  Christ, because he was living in this world in meekness, and innocence,
  and peacefulness. He cried not out, nor was he inclined to bitterness,
  nor did he stir up strife, but endured man's wickedness through his
  meekness. But he who at his first advent mitigated, for the conversion of
  the sinful, will deem stern doom to the reckless at his second

  that is, Comforting Spirit, because he comforts the sad, who repent of
  their sins, and gives them hope of forgiveness, and alleviates their
  sorrowful minds. He forgives sins, and he is the way to forgiveness of
  all sins. He gives his grace to whom he will. To one man he gives wisdom
  and eloquence, to one good knowledge, to one great faith, to one power to
  heal the sick, to one prophetic power, to one discrimination of good and
  evil spirits; to one he gives divers tongues, to one interpretation of
  divers sayings. The Holy Ghost does all these things, distributing to
  everyone as to him seems good; for he is the Almighty Worker, and as soon
  as he enlightens the mind of a man, he turns it from evil to good. He
  enlightened the heart of David, when in youth he loved the harp, and made
  him to be a psalmist. There was a cow-herd called Amos, whom the Holy
  Ghost turned to a great prophet. Peter was a fisher, whom the <!-- Page

  Spirit of God turned to an apostle. Paul persecuted christian men, whom
  he chose for instructer of all nations. Matthew was a toll-gatherer, whom
  he turned to an evangelist. The apostles durst not preach the true faith,
  for fear of the Jewish folk; but after that they were fired by the Holy
  Ghost, they despised all bodily tortures, and fearlessly preached the
  greatness of God.</p>

  <p>The dignity of this day is to be celebrated, because Almighty God,
  that is the Holy Ghost, himself vouchsafed to visit the children of men
  at this time. At the birth of Christ the Almighty Son of God became human
  man, and on this day believing men became gods, as Christ said; "I said,
  Ye are gods, and ye are all children of the Highest." The chosen are
  children of God, and also gods, not naturally, but through grace of the
  Holy Ghost. One God is naturally in three persons, the Father, and his
  Son, that is, his Wisdom, and the Holy Ghost, who is the Love and Will of
  them both. Their nature is indivisible, ever existing in one Godhead. The
  same has, nevertheless, said of his chosen, "Ye are gods." Through
  Christ's humanity men were redeemed from the thraldom of the devil, and
  through the coming of the Holy Ghost human men were made gods. Christ
  received human nature at his advent, and men received God through
  visitation of the Holy Ghost. The man who has not in him the Spirit of
  God is not God's. Every man's works show what spirit directs him. The
  Spirit of God ever directs to holiness and goodness; the spirit of the
  devil directs to sins and deeds of wickedness.</p>

  his Spirit on his disciples for a sign that they and all christian <!--

  twice over the apostles. So also there is one love and two commandments,
  That we should love God and men. But we should learn by men how we may
  come to the love of God, as John the apostle said, "He who loveth not his

  <p>We celebrate the advent of the Holy Ghost with hymns for seven days,
  because he stimulates our mind with a sevenfold gift, that is, with
  wisdom and understanding, with counsel and strength, with knowledge and
  piety, and he fills us with awe of God. He who through good deserts
  attains to these sevenfold gifts of the Holy Ghost will have all honour.
  But he who will attain to this honour shall believe in the Holy Trinity,
  and in True Unity, that the Father, and his Son, and the Spirit of them
  both are three in persons, and one God indivisible, existing in one
  Godhead. This faith was betokened by the three thousand who first
  inclined to belief, after the advent of the Holy Ghost. As those three
  thousand were one company, so is the Holy Trinity one God. And that
  company was as unanimous as though they all had one heart and one soul;

  <p>This gospel is now simply said. The holy pope Gregory has revealed to
  us the mystery of this text. He said, "The holy gospel did not express
  that the rich man was a robber, but that he was parsimonious, and exulted
  in his wealth." By this it is to be considered how he will be punished
  who bereaves another, when he is condemned to hell, who would not give
  his own for love of God. This man's parsimony and pride sank him into
  quick torment, because he had no compassion, so that with his treasure he
  might have redeemed his own soul. Now some men will imagine that there is
  no peril in precious garments, but if there were no sin, the holy gospel
  would not have so evidently manifested with respect to the rich man, that
  he was adorned with purple and with fine linen. No man heeds precious
  garments save for vain pride, verily that he may through his splendour be
  accounted before other men. The Lord in another place praised John <!--

  Baptist for the rudeness of his garment, because he was clothed with
  camel's hair, poorly and ruggedly.</p>

  <p>When Jesus spake of the rich man he said, "There was a certain rich
  man." Again, of the poor man, "There was a certain poor man called
  Lazarus." It is known to you that a rich man is more known by name among
  his people than a poor one; nevertheless Jesus named not the wealthy man,
  but the needy one; because the names of humble men are known to him
  through election, but he knows not the proud through their rejection.
  Some excuse the rich man might have had for his parsimony, if the leprous
  beggar had not lain before his sight: the mind of the poor man would also
  have been easier, if he had not seen the rich man's wealth. Divers
  afflictions he endured, seeing that he had neither nourishment, nor
  health, nor garments, and saw the rich man, hale and sumptuously
  decorated, enjoying his luxuries. For the beggar his infirmity had been
  enough, though he had had food; and again, his indigence had been enough
  for him, although he had been healthful. But the manifold hardship was
  the cleansing of his soul, and the parsimony and pride of the rich man
  were his condemnation; because he saw the other's misery, and with
  inflated mind despised him. But when he was despised of men, the dogs
  approached, and licked his wounds. The licking of a dog heals wounds.</p>

  <p>It then happened that the beggar died, and angels bare his soul to the
  dwelling of the patriarch Abraham; and the rich man's spirit after death
  was sunk into hell; and he then wished to have him for protector, to whom
  he would not before give his crumbs. He then bade Abraham with piteous
  voice, that Lazarus might moisten his tongue; but that little favour was
  not granted him, because Lazarus might not before in life gather the
  crumbs of his table. He particularly complained of his tongue, because it
  is usual that the wealthy in their feasting practise pernicious scoffing;
  therefore was his tongue, through righteous retribution, more harshly
  punished <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Abraham said to him, "My son, be thou mindful that thou receivedst riches
  in thy life, and Lazarus misery." This saying is rather to be feared than
  expounded. The rich man was requited with transitory prosperity, if he
  did aught of good; and the poor man was requited with misery, if he had
  perpetrated aught of evil. Then the wealthy man received his happiness in
  reward for short enjoyment, and the indigence of the needy one cleansed
  away his little sins. Poverty afflicted and purified him; his abundance

  <p>Now says the holy Gregory, there was a reverend monk in the country of
  Lycaonia, very pious, his name was Martyrius. He went by order of his
  abbot to some other monastery, on his errand, when he found a leper lying
  by the way all chapped, and having no power of his feet: he said he
  wished to reach his hut, if he could. Then the monk was grieved for the
  helplessness of the leper, and he wrapt him in his cloak and bare him
  towards his monastery. Then it was disclosed to his abbot whom he was
  bearing, and he cried with a loud voice, and said, "Run, run, and undo
  the gate of the monastery quickly, for our brother Martyrius bears Jesus
  on his back." When the monk had reached the gate of the monastery, he who
  seemed a leper quitted his neck, and appeared in the likeness of Christ.
  The monk then looked up, and beheld how he ascended to heaven. Then said
  Jesus, while ascending, "Martyrius, thou wast not ashamed of me on earth,
  nor will I be ashamed of thee in heaven." Then the abbot hastened towards
  the monk, and eagerly said, "My brother, where is he whom thou didst
  carry?" He said, "If I had known who he was, I would have lain at his
  feet. When I bore him I felt no heaviness of any burthen." How could he
  feel the heaviness of any weight, when he carried one who bore him? Now
  says the holy Gregory, Jesus verified the saying which he himself said,
  "That which ye do for the poor in my name, that ye do for myself."</p>

  <p>These words are obscure, but the expounder Gregory has opened to us
  the ghostly meaning. My dearest brothers, ye have heard in this
  evangelical lesson, that the sinful approached to the speech of Jesus,
  and also to his refection; and the Jewish scribes censured that with
  heat; but their censure was not from righteousness, but from envy. They
  were sick, though they observed it not. Then would the heavenly leech
  with a pleasant parable benevolently heal the swelling of their hearts,
  and thus said, "Which of you hath an hundred sheep, and if he lose one of
  the sheep, then leaveth he [not] the ninety and nine in the waste, and
  goeth seeking the one that he lost?" An hundredfold number is perfect,
  and the Almighty had an hundred sheep, when the host of angels and
  mankind were his possessions: but he lost one sheep, when the
  first-created man Adam through sin lost the food of Paradise. Then the
  Almighty Son of God left all the host of angels in heaven, and went to
  earth, and sought that one <!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page341"></a>{341}</span>sheep that had escaped from him. When he
  had found it, he bare it on his shoulders to the flock rejoicing. When he
  assumed our human nature, and bare our sins, then was the wandering sheep
  brought back on his holy shoulders. The master of the sheep came home,
  having found his sheep; for Christ after his passion, whereby he redeemed
  mankind, arose from death, and ascended to heaven rejoicing.</p>

  <p>We have frequently seen that those brethren, who have not fallen into
  deadly sins, are not altogether so careful to practise a hard course of
  life, as though they were careless because they had not perpetrated
  deadly sins; and that others who acknowledge the grievous sins that they
  have committed in youth, are pricked with great affliction. They despise
  permitted and visible things, and with weeping desire those invisible and
  heavenly. They despise and humble themselves in all things; and because
  through error they have departed from their Creator, they desire to
  repair the consequent injury with heavenly gains. Greater joy there will
  be in heaven over the converted sinner, through such endurances, than
  over a remiss one who is confident in himself, that he has perpetrated
  little <!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page343"></a>{343}</span>and few sins, and at the same time cares
  but little about God's commandments and his soul's need. Greater love a
  general feels in battle for the soldier who after flight boldly overcomes
  his adversary, than for him who never took to flight, nor yet in any
  conflict performed any deed of valour. In like manner the husbandman
  loves the field which after thorns and brambles yields abundant fruits,
  more than he loves that which was not thorny nor is fruitful. There are,
  nevertheless, very many righteous guiltless of deadly sins, and yet
  practise as severe a course of life as though they were troubled with all
  sins. With these can no penitent sinner be compared, because they are
  righteous and repentant. By this is to be judged how greatly the
  righteous with humble lamentation gladdens God, if the unrighteous with
  true penitence can gladden him.</p>

  <p>Angeli are interpreted, God's messengers; archangeli, high messengers;
  virtutes, powers, by which God works many miracles. Potestates are powers
  which have power over the accursed spirits, that they may not tempt the
  hearts of believing men so much as they desire. Principatus are
  authorities which have charge of the good angels, and they by their
  direction fulfil the divine mysteries. Dominationes are interpreted,
  lordships, because the other hosts of angels obey them with great
  subjection. Throni are thrones which are filled with such great grace of
  the Almighty Godhead, that the <!-- Page 345 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  through them decides his dooms. Cherubim are interpreted, fullness of
  knowledge or understanding: they are filled with so much the more
  understanding as they are nearer to their Creator through the worthiness
  of their deserts. Seraphim are interpreted burning, or inflaming: they
  are so much the more burning in love of God as they are associated with
  him; for there are no other angels between them and the Almighty God.
  They are burning, not in wise of fire, but with great love of the
  Powerful King. God's kingdom is composed of hosts of angels and of
  religious men, and we believe that of mankind as great a number will
  ascend to that sublime realm as there remained of holy spirits in heaven
  after the fall of the accursed spirits.</p>

  is the Son of God in his Godhead, and the Son of God and of a maiden by
  his human nature. John fled from the presence of people in his youth, and
  in the waste, with austere life-course, avoided sin. Jesus continued
  among the sinful pure from every sin. The crier inclined, at that time, a
  great body of the people of Israel to their Creator by his announcement.
  The Lord daily inclines souls without number of all nations to his faith,
  through enlightening of the Holy Ghost.</p>

  <p>The holy gospel says of the Baptist, that he preceded Jesus in spirit
  and in power of the prophet Elias; because he was his forerunner at his
  first advent, as Elias will be at the second against Antichrist. It is
  not without signification that the birth of the crier was completed on
  the day when the worldly day is waning, and that it is waxing on the
  birth-tide of the Lord. This signification the same John revealed in
  these words, "It is befitting Christ that he wax, and me that I be
  waning." John was sooner known to men, through his illustrious
  life-course, than Christ was, for He manifested not his divine power, ere
  that he had been thirty years in human nature. Then it seemed to the
  people that he was a prophet, and that John was Christ. But Christ
  manifested himself by many great miracles, and his fame waxed through all
  the world, that he was true God, who before that had seemed a prophet.
  But John was waning in his fame, for he was <!-- Page 359 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page359"></a>{359}</span>acknowledged a prophet,
  and the proclaimer of the Heavenly Prince, who a little before had by
  uncertain supposition been accounted Christ. The waning day of his
  birth-tide betokens this waning, and the increasing day of the birth of
  Jesus signifies his increasing power according to his human nature.</p>

  wisdom. The evangelist John began the evangelical memorial with the Word,
  thus saying, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
  and the Word was God." He is called Lamb, from the innocence of the
  lamb's nature; and was guiltless, for our redemption, offered a living
  sacrifice to his Father in the manner of a lamb. He is called the Lion of
  the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, because, through his godly

  John the kingdom of God suffereth compulsion, and the violent seize it."
  It is known to every intelligent man, that the old law was easier than
  the Institute of Christ is, for in it there was no great continence nor
  the ghostly courses which Christ and his apostles afterwards established.
  One thing is the institute which the king ordains through his nobles or
  officials, another is his own edict in his presence. The holy church is
  in this place called God's kingdom, that is, all christian people, who
  shall with force and violence earn the heavenly kingdom. <!-- Page 361

  for munificence, without violence? But he who, through God's support, so
  changes his ways with steadfastness, will then be made another man;
  another he will be in goodness, and the same in substance, and he will

  <p>There are two kinds of continence, one bodily, the other ghostly. One
  is, that everyone govern himself with moderation in food and in drink,
  and manfully remove from himself superfluous aliment. The second kind of
  continence is more precious and exalted,&mdash;though the other is
  good,&mdash;to guide the agitation of his mind with constant moderation,
  and fight daily against sins, and chastise himself with the sternness of
  ghostly correction, so that he restrain the fierce beast of the eight
  capital sins as it were with iron bonds. Precious is this continence and
  glorious suffering in the sight of God, to govern evil thoughts and
  sinful pleasures with our own sceptre, and to abstain from injurious
  speech and perilous work, as from death-bearing meats. He who sedulously
  performs these things, seizes undoubtedly the promised kingdom with God
  and all his saints. Great violence it is through which human beings with
  humble merits obtain that heavenly joy, which the heavenly angels lost

  <p>It delights us to speak yet further of the holy man John, for his
  honour and our bettering. Of him the prophet Isaiah wrote, that he is
  "the voice of one crying in the waste, Prepare the way of God, make right
  his paths. Every valley shall be filled, and every hill shall be lowered,
  and all crookednesses shall be straightened, and sharpnesses smoothed."
  The prophet called himself a voice, because he preceded <!-- Page 363
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>{363}</span>Christ, who is
  called the Word: not such a word as men speak, but he is the Wisdom of
  the Father, and a word is the manifestation of wisdom. The Word is
  Almighty God, the Son with his Father. In every word the voice is heard
  before the word is fully spoken. As the voice precedes the word, so did
  John precede Jesus on earth; for God the Father sent him before the sight
  of his Son, that he might prepare and make ready his way. But John cried
  these same words to men, "Prepare the way of God." The crier who
  announces right belief and good works, prepares the way for the coming
  God to the heart of the hearkeners.</p>

  proud. At the Lord's advent valleys shall be filled, and hills lowered,
  as he himself said, "Everyone of them who exalteth himself shall be
  humbled, and he who humbleth himself shall be exalted." As water rushes
  from the hill and stands in the valley, so flees the Holy Ghost from the
  heart of proud men, and takes his dwelling in the humble, as the prophet

  Crookednesses shall be straight, when the hearts of perverse men, which

  answered him, "O sir, why shall I answer this lost adversary? If thou
  wilt obey his words, thou wilt injure thy soul, and also thy kingdom.
  Concerning my teaching, which thou askest, I will answer thee. Jesus, who
  while present taught Peter, the same by revelation taught me; and I have
  filled with the precepts of God from Jerusalem until I came to Illyricum.
  I taught that men should love and honour each other. I taught the rich
  not to exalt themselves, nor to place their hope in false wealth, but in
  God alone. I taught men of moderate means to be frugal in their food and
  clothing. I enjoined the poor to rejoice in their indigence. Fathers I
  exhorted to bring up their children in the fear of God. Children I
  enjoined to be obedient to the salutary admonitions of father and mother.
  I taught husbands to keep inviolate their wedlock, because that which a
  man punishes in an adulterous wife, God will avenge in an adulterous
  husband. I exhorted pious wives inwardly to love their husbands, and with
  awe obey them as masters. I taught masters to be kind to their servants;
  because they are brothers before God, the master and the servant. I
  commanded serving men faithfully and as God to serve their masters. I
  taught all believing men to worship one God Almighty and invisible. I
  learned not this lore of any earthly man, but <!-- Page 381 --><span

  <p>We will now run over this reading with a short exposition, and explain
  any obscurity there may be contained in it. Paul persecuted christian
  men, not with hate, as the Jews did, but he was a partizan and defender
  of the old law with great steadfastness: he thought that the faith of
  Christ was an adversary to the old covenant: but Jesus who had
  established the old law by divers miracles, the same afterwards by his
  <!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page391"></a>{391}</span>presence changed it to truth, according to
  its ghostly signification. Now Paul knew not the ghostly signification of
  that law, and was therefore its advocate, and a persecutor of the faith
  of Christ. God Almighty, who knows all things, saw his thoughts, that he
  did not persecute faithful men from rancour, but for the defence of the
  old law, and spake to him from heaven, thus saying, "Saul, why
  persecutest thou me? I am the Truth which thou defendest; cease from
  persecution: hurtful will it be to thee to spurn against the goad. If the
  ox spurneth against the goad, it hurteth himself; so also harmeth thee
  thy warfare against me." He said, "Why persecutest thou me?" because he
  is the head of christian men, and bewails whatsoever his limbs suffer on
  earth, as he said through his prophet, "He who toucheth you, it shall be
  to me as painful as if he touched the sight of my eye." He was
  prostrated, thus saying, "Who art thou, Lord?" His pride was prostrated,
  and true humility was raised up in him. He fell unrighteous, and was
  raised righteous. Falling he lost bodily sight, rising he received his
  mind's enlightening. Three days he continued without sight, because he
  had denied the resurrection of Christ on the third day.</p>

  <p>Ananias signifies in the Hebrew tongue, <i>sheep</i>. The gentle sheep
  then baptized the impious Saul, and made him the pious Paul. He baptized
  the wolf and made him a lamb. He changed his name with his character; and
  he was then a true proclaimer of God's church, who had before afflicted
  it with fierce persecution. He would flee from the machination of the
  Jewish people, and consented to be let down in a basket over the wall:
  not because he would not suffer death for the faith of Christ, but
  because he would flee from immature death; for he had first to gain many
  a man to God by his great wisdom, and afterwards with great honour
  stretch out his neck to martyrdom. Much greater torments he suffered
  afterwards for Christ's name, than he had ordered for <!-- Page 393
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page393"></a>{393}</span>christian men
  before his conversion. Saul the impious scourged the christians, but
  after his conversion the pious Paul for the name of Christ was often
  scourged. Once he was stoned almost to death, so that his persecutors
  left him for dead, but in the morning he arose and went about his
  preaching. He was frequently in great peril, both by sea and by land, in
  the waste, among thieves, from hunger and from thirst, and from many
  watchings, from cold, and from nakedness, and from many prisons: he so
  hastened with his preaching, as though he would bring all mankind to
  God's kingdom: as well with precepts as with prayers and with letters, he
  ever stimulated to the will of God. He was led to heaven as far as the
  third flooring, and there he saw and heard God's secret, which he might
  not make known to any man. He bewailed with weeping the sins of other
  men, and to all the faithful he showed fatherly love. By his handicraft
  he toiled for his own and his companions' support, and in addition
  thereto there was nothing known in true piety which his instruction did
  not confirm. The other apostles lived, by God's command, by their
  teaching, free from danger; but, nevertheless, Paul alone, who by worldly
  craft was a tent-wright, would not receive the sustenance allowed, but by
  his own toil provided for his own and his companions' need. His precepts
  and his acts are to us inscrutable, but happy will he be who obeys his
  admonitions with diligence.</p>

  was a fisher, and by that craft provided for himself, and yet he spake
  with great boldness, "We have forsaken all things." But he and his
  brothers forsook much, when they forsook the will to possess. Though any
  one forsake great possessions, and forsake not avarice, he forsakes not
  all things. Peter forsook little things, scrip and net, but he forsook
  all things, when, for love of God, he would have nothing. He said, "We
  follow thee." It is not complete to forsake many possessions, unless a
  man follow God. For the heathen philosophers forsook many things, as
  Socrates did, who exchanged all his possessions for a wedge of gold, and
  then cast the wedge into the wide sea, that desire of possessions might
  not obstruct his will, and draw it from the worldly lore that he loved:
  but it profited him not so to do, because he did not follow God, but his
  own will, and had not therefore heavenly reward with the apostles, who,
  for love of Christ, despised all worldly things, and with obedience
  followed him.</p>

  <p>There is a great difference among converted men: some imitate the

  The servant followed the great prophet Elisha: then there came to him a
  rich man of the nation which is called Syria, his name was Naaman, and he
  was leprous. He came then to God's prophet, Elisha, in Judea, and he,
  through God's might, healed him from that disease. He then offered to the
  man of God, for his health, precious treasures. The prophet answered him,
  "God's might hath healed thee, not I. I will not receive thy money: thank
  God for thy health, and enjoy thy possessions." Naaman then returned with
  all his company to his own people.</p>

  <p>Gregory the expounder said, that Jesus bewailed the overthrow of the

  because they would sinfully slay the heavenly Prince. He spake with
  weeping voice, not to the work-stones, nor to the building, but spake to
  the inhabitants, whom he bewailed with fatherly love, because he knew
  that their destruction was speedily to take place. A space of forty years
  the mercy of God left the cruel inhabitants for repentance of their
  crimes, but they cared for no penitence, but perpetrated greater crimes,
  so that they slew with stones Stephen, the first martyr of God, and
  beheaded James, the brother of John. The righteous James also they thrust
  from the temple, and slew, and raised persecution against the other
  apostles. The congregation of God which, after Christ's passion, was
  continuing in the city under the righteous James, went all together from
  the city to a village on the river Jordan; for God's command had come to
  them, that they should go from the wicked place, ere the vengeance came.
  God knew then that the Jews cared for no penitence, but more and more
  increased their crimes: he therefore sent to them the Roman people, and
  they ruined them all.</p>

  <p>Vespasian the emperor was called, who in those days ruled the kingdom
  of the whole world. He sent his son Titus to conquer the miserable Jews.
  It then so happened that they were assembled within the city of
  Jerusalem, six hundred thousand men, enclosed as it were in a prison; and
  they were surrounded without by the Roman army so long that many
  thousands were killed by hunger; and they could not bury them by reason
  of the number, but cast the corpses over the <!-- Page 405 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page405"></a>{405}</span>wall. Some, however,
  would bury them for the sake of kinship, but they soon died from
  weakness. If any one had provided any little sustenance for himself,
  robbers would suddenly rush on him, and pull the meat from his mouth.
  Some chewed their shoes, some their garments, some straw, for the great
  anguish of hot hunger. It is not fitting that we, in this holy gospel,
  recount all the shameful miseries which befell the besieged Jews before
  they would yield. The greater part of the wicked ones was then destroyed
  by the ignominious famine, and the Roman host slew the leavings of the
  famine, and razed the city to the ground, so that there remained not
  stone over stone, as Jesus had erewhile with weeping prophesied. Of boys
  who were within sixteen years of age, they sent ninety thousand to all
  nations in slavery, and in the country there remained nothing of the
  accursed race. The city was afterwards built in another place, and
  peopled with Saracens.</p>

  <p>Jesus showed for what cause this dispersion of the city happened, when
  he said, "Because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation." He
  visited the inhabitants in his humanity, but they were not mindful of
  him, neither by love nor by fear. Of that heedlessness the prophet spake
  with lamenting voice, thus saying, "The stork and the swallow keep the
  time of their coming, and this people knew not the doom of God." The Lord
  said to the city, "If thou knewest what is to befall thee, then wouldst
  thou weep with me. Verily on this day thou dwellest in peace, for the
  vengeances to come are now hidden from thine eyes." The inhabitants were
  dwelling in worldly peace, while they were heedlessly subservient to
  fleshly lusts, and little thought of the miseries to come, which were yet
  hidden from them. If they had been foreknowing of that misery, they could
  not with heedless mind have enjoyed the prosperity of the present

  <p>The Lord drove the chapmen from the temple, thus saying, "It is
  written, that my house is a house of prayer, and ye have made it a den
  for thieves." The temple was hallowed to God, for his services, and songs
  of praise, and prayers of the faithful; but the covetous high-priests
  allowed chapping to be held therein. The Lord, when he saw that
  wickedness, made a scourge of ropes, and with beating hurried them all
  out. This dispersion betokened the future destruction by the Roman army,
  and the ruin happened chiefly through the sins of the high-priests, who,
  dwelling within the temple, with pretended holiness received the people's
  offerings, and persecuted those men who sought the temple without
  offerings. What was that temple but, as it were, a den of thieves, when
  the chief priests were filled with such covetousness, and allowed false
  bargains within the house of God? It is written in another gospel, that
  there sat moneyers, and there were oxen for sale, and sheep, and doves.
  In those days, according to the institute of the old law, they offered
  oxen, and sheep, and doves, in token of Christ's passion: then
  covetousness stimulated the priests to have such animals there for sale,
  that, if any one came from afar, and would offer his gift to God, he
  might have it ready at hand to buy. The Lord then drove such chapmen from
  the holy temple, because it was not raised for any trading, but for
  prayers.</p>

  and was teaching the folk daily within the temple." The merciful Lord,
  who lets his sun shine over the righteous and unrighteous alike, and
  sends rains and earthly fruits to the good and evil, would not withdraw
  his instruction from the perverse Jews, because many were good among the
  evil, who were bettered by that instruction, although the perverse

  evil deeds, and rejoice in the worst things. Such men the merciful Lord

  <p>Verily this following sentence applies to the perishing soul, "On this

  thine eyes." The perverse soul is indeed dwelling in peace in its day,
  when in transient time it rejoices, and is exalted with dignities, and in
  temporary enjoyments is immoderate, and is dissolved in fleshly lusts,
  and is awed by no fear of future punishment, but hides from itself the
  miseries following after; because if it reflect on them, then will
  worldly bliss be troubled by that reflection. It has then peace in its
  day, when it will not afflict the present mirth with any care for the
  future unhappiness, but goes with closed eyes to the penal fire. The soul
  which in this wise now lives, shall be afflicted when the righteous
  rejoice; and all the perishable things, which it now accounts as peace
  and bliss, shall then be turned for it to bitterness and strife; for it
  will have great contention with itself, why it would not before in life
  with any carefulness foresee the condemnation which it then is suffering.
  Concerning which it is written, "Blessed is the man who is ever fearing;
  and verily the hardened shall fall into evil." Again in another place

  <p>The holy lesson says, "The time cometh that thy foes shall encompass
  thee with a leaguer, and shall straiten thee on <!-- Page 411 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page411"></a>{411}</span>every side, and shall
  prostrate thee to earth, together with thy children which are in thee."
  The foes of the soul are the hellish spirits which beset a man's
  departure, and with great tribulation will lead his soul, if it be
  sinful, to the fellowship of their own damnation. The devils show to the
  sinful soul its evil thoughts, and pernicious speeches, and wicked deeds,
  and with manifold reproaches afflict it, that on its departure it may
  know by what foes it is beset, and yet find no outlet whereby it may flee
  from the hostile spirits. To earth it shall be prostrated by a knowledge
  of its sins, when the body in which it lived shall be rotted to dust. Its
  children shall fall in death, when the unallowed thoughts, which it now
  gives birth to, shall, in the last vengeance, be wholly rendered vain, as
  the psalmist melodiously sang, "Trust not in princes, nor in the children
  of men, in whom there is no health. Their spirit departs, and they return
  to earth, and in that day all their thoughts perish."</p>

  perversity over perversity, what does it, but as though it lay stone over
  stone? But when the soul shall be led to its punishment, then will all
  the structure of its cogitation be overthrown; for it knew not the time
  of its visitation. In many ways the Almighty God visits the souls of men;
  sometimes with instruction, sometimes with miracles, sometimes with
  diseases; but if it neglect these visitations, it will be at its end
  delivered for eternal punishment to fiends, whom it had previously with
  deadly sins obeyed in life. Then shall those be its tormentors in

  <p>"And he was teaching daily within the temple." Christ then taught the
  people in his presence, and he now daily teaches the minds of believing
  men with godly lore, by meditation, to eschew evil and perform good. It
  is not perfect for the believing man to cease from evil, unless he
  performs good. The blessed Gregory said, "My brothers, I would relate to
  you a little narrative, which may greatly edify your minds, if ye with
  heedfulness will hear it. There was a <!-- Page 415 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page415"></a>{415}</span>certain nobleman in the
  province of Valeria, who was called Chrysaurius, who was as much filled
  with sins as he was enriched with earthly riches. He was inflated with
  pride, and a slave to his fleshly lusts, and inflamed with excessive
  covetousness. But when God designed to put an end to his wickedness, he
  became sick, and brought to departure hence. Then at the very time that
  he should die, he looked up, and there stood about him swart spirits, and
  in a great company descended on him, that they might snatch his soul, on
  its departure, with them to the barriers of hell. He began then to
  tremble and grow pale, and incredibly to sweat, and with great cry to
  pray for a respite, and with troubled voice called his son Maximus, whom
  I afterwards saw as a monk, and said, My child, Maximus, help me; receive
  me in thy faith: I have not in any way been hurtful to thee. The son
  Maximus then, troubled with great sorrowing, came to him. He was then
  turning like a worm; he could not endure the dreadful sight of the
  accursed spirits. He turned himself to the wall, there they were present
  to him; he turned back again, there he found them. When he, so greatly
  afflicted, was hopeless of himself, he cried with a loud voice, and thus
  said, Grant me a respite till to-morrow, at least a respite till
  to-morrow: and with this cry the black fiends drew the soul from the
  body, and led it away." From this it is manifest, that the vision was
  shown to him for the bettering of other men, not for his own. Alas, what
  did it profit him, though, on his departure, he saw the swart spirits,
  when he might not have the respite which he desired? But let us be
  careful, that our time escape not from us in vanity, and we turn to good
  deeds, when death urges us to departure.</p>

  <p>In the time of Decius, the cruel emperor, the holy bishop Sixtus was
  dwelling in Rome. Then he suddenly commanded his counts to bring the
  bishop together with his priests before him. Sixtus then with fearless
  mind called to his priests, "My brothers, be ye not afraid, come, and let
  none of you dread short torments. The holy martyrs suffered many
  tortures, that they might fearless come to the glory-crown of everlasting
  life." His two deacons, Felicissimus and Agapetus, then answered, "Thou,
  our father, whither shall we go without thee?" On that night the bishop
  with his two deacons was quickly brought to the cruel persecutor. The
  emperor Decius said to him, "Offer thy gift to the immortal gods, and be
  thou the chief of the priests." The blessed Sixtus answered him, "I have
  ever offered and will yet offer my gift to the Almighty God, and his Son,
  Jesus Christ, and to the Holy Ghost, in pure and unpolluted sacrifice."
  Decius said, "Take heed for thyself and thy priests, and offer; for if
  thou dost not, thou shalt be an example to all others." But Sixtus
  answered, "A little before I said to thee, that I always offer to
  Almighty God." Decius then said to his soldiers, "Lead him to the temple
  of Mars, that he may offer to the god Mars: if he will not offer, shut
  him in the prison Mamortinum." The soldiers led him to the temple, and
  urged him to offer his gift to the dead image. When he despised the
  emperor's command, and would not offer to the idol, they brought him with
  his two deacons into the dark prison.</p>

  <p>But Lawrence was afterwards brought to the emperor, and the fierce
  executioner asked him, "Where are the church's treasures which were
  committed to thee?" The blessed Lawrence answered him not a word. On the
  same day the foe of God committed the holy deacon to his chief officer
  Valerianus, with this command, "Exact the treasures with importunity, and
  make him bow to the immortal gods." The officer then committed him to his
  junior, whose name was Hippolytus, and he shut him in a prison with many
  others. He found in the prison a heathen man, who was blind through great
  weeping. He said to him, "Lucillus, if thou wilt believe in Jesus Christ,
  he will enlighten thine eyes." He answered, "I have ever desired to be
  baptized in the name of Christ." Lawrence said to him, "Believest thou
  with all thy heart?" He answered with weeping, "I believe in Jesus <!--

  Hippolytus with patience listened to their words. The blessed Lawrence
  then taught the blind man true belief in the Holy Trinity, and baptized
  him. Lucillus, after the baptismal bath, cried with clear voice, "Blessed
  be the Eternal God, Jesus Christ, who has enlightened me through his
  deacon. I was blind with both eyes, now I clearly enjoy the light." Then
  there came many other blind with weeping to the blessed deacon, and he
  set his hand over their eyes, and they were enlightened.</p>

  <p>After this the chief officer sent, and commanded Hippolytus to lead
  Lawrence to the king's court. Hippolytus with humble speech made known
  that command to the blessed Lawrence. He said, "Let us go, for glory is
  prepared for me and for thee." They went quickly, and stood fearless
  before him. Then said Valerianus to the holy martyr, "Cast away now thy
  obstinacy, and give up the treasures." The martyr of God answered him,
  "On God's poor I have spent them, and they are the everlasting treasures
  which will never be diminished." The officer said, "Why playest thou with
  words? Offer thy gift to our gods, and forsake the magic <!-- Page 425
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page425"></a>{425}</span>in which thou
  trustest." Lawrence said, "For what reason does the devil compel you to
  urge christian men to his worship? If it be right that we should pray to
  devils rather than to the Almighty God, judge which is worthy of that
  honour, he who is made, or he who created all things." The emperor then
  answered, "What is he who is made, or what is he who made?" God's martyr
  said, "The Almighty Father of our Saviour is the Creator of all
  creatures, and thou sayest that I shall pray to dumb stones, which are
  carved by the hands of men." The emperor was then wroth, and commanded
  the deacon to be unclothed in his sight, and cruelly scourged, and the
  emperor himself cried, "Insult not our gods." The blessed Lawrence said
  in torments, "Verily I thank my God, who has vouchsafed to number me with
  his holy; and thou, wretch, art afflicted in thy foolishness." Decius
  said to the executioners, "Raise him up, and manifest to his sight all
  the torture-tools." Then were quickly brought forth iron plates, and iron
  claws, and an iron bed, and leaden whips, and other leaded whips. Then
  said the emperor, "Offer thy gift to our gods, or thou shalt be tortured
  with all these torture-tools." The blessed deacon said, "Thou unblessed,
  these luxuries I have ever desired; they will be to me a glory, and to
  thee a torment." The emperor said, "Declare to us all the wicked thy
  like, that this city may be cleansed; and do thou thyself offer to our
  gods, and trust thou in no wise to thy treasures." Then said the holy
  martyr, "Verily I trust, and I am careless for my treasures." Decius
  answered, "Thinkest thou then that thou wilt be redeemed by thy treasures
  from these torments?" and then in angry mood commanded the executioners
  to beat him with stout clubs. But Lawrence, during the beating, cried,
  "Thou wretch, know at least that I triumph regarding Christ's treasures,
  and I feel not thy torments." Decius said, "Lay the <!-- Page 427
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page427"></a>{427}</span>iron plates
  glowing hot to his side." The blessed martyr then was praying to his
  Lord, and said, "Saviour Christ, God of God, have mercy on thy servant,
  for, accused, I denied thee not; questioned, I acknowledged thee." Then
  the emperor commanded him to be raised, and said, "I see that thou,
  through thy magic, mockest these torments; nevertheless thou shalt not
  mock me. I swear by all the gods and goddesses, that thou shalt offer, or
  I will slay thee by divers tortures." Lawrence then boldly cried, "I, in
  the name of my Lord, in no wise fear thy torments, which are transitory:
  cease thou not from what thou hast begun."</p>

  "Saviour Christ, thou who hast vouchsafed to be born a mortal man, and
  hast redeemed us from the devil's thraldom, receive my spirit." At the
  same time an answer came to him from heaven, thus saying, "Yet thou shalt
  have much affliction in thy martyrdom." Decius then furious cried, "Roman
  men, heard ye the comfort of the devils to this impious, who dreads not
  our irritated gods, nor the devised torments? Stretch him, and, scourging
  with leaded whips, afflict him." Lawrence then, stretched on the cross,
  with laughing mouth thanked his Lord, "Lord God, Father of Jesus Christ,
  be thou blessed, who hast given us thy mercy; manifest now thy favour,
  that these standing about may know that thou comfortest thy servants." At
  that time one of the soldiers, whose name was Romanus, believed, and said
  to the martyr of God, "Lawrence, I see God's angel standing before thee
  with a hand-cloth, and wiping thy sweating limbs. I now beseech thee,
  through God, that thou forsake me not." Then was Decius filled with
  guile, and said to his chief officer, "Methinks that we are overcome by
  magic." And he then ordered the holy deacon to be loosened from the
  cross, and delivered to the town-reeve Hippolytus, and knew not yet that
  he was a christian.</p>

  <p>Hippolytus then buried the holy body with great reverence in the
  burial-place of the widow Quiriaca, on this present day. But at the grave
  there watched a great many christian men with great lamentation. The holy
  priest Justin celebrated mass to and houseled them all. After this
  Hippolytus returned to his home, and with God's peace kissed his family,
  and houseled them all. Then suddenly, while he was sitting, the emperor's
  soldiers came, and seized him, and led him to the executioner. Decius
  then asked him with smiling mouth, "What, art thou turned magician, since
  thou hast buried <!-- Page 433 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  a magician, but as a christian." Decius then in wrath ordered his mouth
  to be stricken with stones, and him to be stript, and said, "How, wast
  thou not a diligent worshiper of our gods? and now thou art become so
  foolish that thou art not ashamed of thy nakedness." Hippolytus answered,
  "I was foolish, and I am now wise and a christian. Through ignorance I
  believed in the error in which thou believest." Decius said, "Offer to
  the gods, lest, as Lawrence, thou perish by torments." He answered, "O,
  if I might imitate the blessed Lawrence!" Decius said, "Stretch him thus
  naked, and beat him with strong clubs." When he had long been beaten he
  thanked God. Decius said, "Hippolytus mocks your staves, scourge him with
  leaded whips." They then did so, till they were worn out. Hippolytus
  cried with a loud voice, "I am a christian." So the fierce emperor, when
  he could not, by any torments, seduce him from belief in Christ,
  commanded his chief officer to slay him by the most cruel death.</p>

  <p>The Lord, through his piety, committed the blessed maiden his mother
  to the chaste man John, who had ever lived in pure virginity; and on that
  account he was especially dear to the Lord, so much so that he would
  commit to him that precious treasure, the queen of the whole world: no
  doubt, that her most pure virginity might be associated with that chaste
  man with grateful fellowship in pleasant converse. In them both was one
  virtue of unbroken chastity, but a second attribute in Mary; in her is
  fruitful virginity, so as in no other. In no other person is there
  virginity, if there be fruitfulness; nor fruitfulness, if there be
  perfect virginity. Therefore now are hallowed both the virginity of Mary
  and her fruitfulness through the divine birth; and she excels all others
  in virginity and in fruitfulness. Nevertheless, though she was especially
  committed to the care of John, yet she lived in common, after Christ's
  ascension, with the apostolic company, going in and going out among them,
  and they all with great piety and love ministered to her, and she fully
  <!-- Page 441 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  Christ's humanity; for she had from the beginning accurately learned them
  through the Holy Ghost, and seen them with her own sight; though the
  apostles understood all things through the same Ghost, and were
  instructed in all truth. The archangel Gabriel held her uncorrupted, and
  she continued in the care of John and of all the apostles, in the
  heavenly company, meditating on God's law, until God, on this day, took
  her to the heavenly throne, and exalted her above the hosts of

  Christ's resurrection, unless they had been raised for ever. Nor do we

  <p>There is no doubt that all the heavenly host then with unspeakable
  bliss would rejoice in her advent. Verily we also believe that the Lord
  himself came to meet her, and benignly with delight placed her by him on
  his throne: for he would fulfil in himself what he had in his law
  enjoined, thus saying, "Honour thy father and thy mother." He is his own
  witness that he honoured his Father, as he said to the Jews, "I honour my
  Father, and ye dishonour me." In his human state he honoured his mother,
  when he was, as the holy gospel says, subjected to her in his youth. Much
  more is it to be believed that he honoured his mother with unspeakable
  veneration in his kingdom, when he would, according to human nature, obey
  her in this life.</p>

  <p>Of this heavenly queen it is yet said by the same Spirit of God, "I
  saw the beauteous one as a dove mounting above the streaming rills, and
  an ineffable fragrance exhaled from her garments; and, so as in the
  spring-tide, blossoms of roses and lilies encircled her." The blossoms of
  roses betoken by their redness martyrdom, and the lilies by their
  whiteness betoken the shining purity of inviolate maidenhood. All the
  chosen who have thriven to God through martyrdom or through chastity,
  they all journeyed with the blessed queen; for she is herself both martyr
  and maiden. She is as beauteous as a dove, for she loved meekness, which
  the Holy Ghost betokened, when he appeared in likeness of a dove over
  Christ at his baptism. Other martyrs suffered martyrdom in their bodies
  for Christ's faith, but the blessed Mary was not bodily martyred, but her
  soul was sorely afflicted with great suffering, when she stood sad before
  Christ's rood, and saw her dear child fastened with iron nails on the
  hard tree. Therefore is she more than a martyr, for she suffered that
  martyrdom in her soul which other martyrs suffered in their bodies. She
  loved Christ above all other men, and, therefore, was her pain also for
  him greater than other men's, and she made his death as her own death,
  for his suffering pierced her soul as a sword.</p>

  <p>There was a certain bishop named Basilius, who had learned in a school
  together with this same Julian. It so happened that Basilius was chosen
  to be bishop of a place called Cappadocia, and Julian to be emperor,
  though he earlier had been shorn for a priest. Julian then began to love
  idolatry, and renounced his christianity, and with all his mind
  cultivated heathenism, and compelled his people to the same. Then at a
  certain time he went on an expedition against the Persian nation, and met
  the bishop, and said to him, "O thou Basilius, I have now excelled thee
  in philosophy." The bishop answered, "God has granted to you to cultivate
  philosophy:" <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page451"></a>{451}</span>and with that word he offered him such a
  gift as he himself partook of, that was three barley loaves, for a
  blessing. Then the apostate commanded the loaves to be received, and
  grass to be given to the bishop in return, and said, "He has offered us
  the food of beasts, let him receive grass in reward." Basilius received
  the grass, thus saying, "O thou emperor, verily we have offered to thee
  what we ourselves partake of, and thou hast given us in reward the
  sustenance of irrational beasts, not as food for us but as insult." The
  adversary of God then became angry, and said, "When I return from the
  expedition I will overthrow this city, and level it, and turn it to
  arable land, so that it shall be cornbearing rather than manbearing. Thy
  audacity and that of these citizens is not unknown to me, who at thy
  instigation brake and cast down the image which I had raised and prayed
  to." And with these words he went to the Persian territory.</p>

  mind brought to him of gold, and silver, and precious gems an immense
  heap. Thereupon the bishop received the treasures, and commanded his
  priests and all the people to offer their gifts within the temple that
  was hallowed to the honour of the blessed Mary, and bade them therein
  abide, with a fast of three days, that the Almighty Ruler, through his
  mother's intercession, might turn to naught the resolve of the
  unrighteous emperor. Then on the third night of the fast the bishop saw a
  great heavenly host on each side of the temple, and in the midst of the
  host sat the heavenly queen Mary, and said to her attendants, "Bring to
  me the martyr Mercurius, that he may go against the impious apostate
  Julian, and slay him, who with inflated mind despises God my Son." The
  holy martyr Mercurius <!-- Page 453 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  command. The bishop then went into the other church, in which the martyr
  lay, and asked the churchward, where the weapons of the saint were? He
  swore that he certainly saw them at his head in the evening. And he
  straightways returned to St. Mary's temple, and made known to the people
  what he had seen, and the destruction of the tyrant. He then went again
  to the holy martyr's sepulchre, and found his spear standing stained with

  the blind and the halt, whom he had himself previously afflicted. He
  injured men's sight, and afflicted their bodies with divers diseases, and

  Bartholomew came within the temple." They asked, "Who is Bartholomew?"

  to this province that he may render vain all the idols which these
  Indians worship." They said, "Describe to us his countenance, that we may
  know him." Berith answered them, "He has fair and curling locks, is white
  of body, and has deep eyes and moderate sized nose, and ample beard,
  somewhat hoary, a middling stature, and is clad in a white upper garment,
  and is within six and twenty years old: his raiment is not dirty nor
  threadbare, nor are his shoes worn out. A hundred times he bows his knees
  by day, and a hundred times by night, praying to his Lord. His voice is
  as an immense trumpet, and God's angels go with him, who allow not hunger
  to hurt him, nor any faintness. He is ever of one mind, and continues
  glad. All things he foresees and knows, and he understands the tongues of
  all nations. Now long ago he knows what I am saying of him, for God's
  angels minister and make known all things to him. When ye seek him, if he
  himself will, ye will find him; if he will not, verily ye will find him
  not. I pray you that ye earnestly beseech him not to come hither, lest
  God's angels who are with him command to me what they have commanded to
  my companion Ashtaroth." And with these words the devil was silent.</p>

  Christ, who through his innocent death overpowered the devil, has sent us
  among all nations, to drive away the devil's ministers, who dwell in
  images, and to withdraw the heathen who worship them from their power.
  But we receive not gold nor silver, but despise, as Christ despised them;
  for we desire to be rich in his kingdom, in which neither sickness, nor
  infirmity, nor sadness, nor death, has any place, but there is eternal
  happiness and bliss, joy without end with eternal riches. Therefore came
  I to your temple, and the devil, who answered you through the image, is
  made captive by the angels of God who sent me. And if thou consentest to
  be baptized, I will cause thee to see the devil, and to hear by what
  craft he appears to heal sickness. The accursed devil, after that he had
  deceived the first-created man, had power over unbelieving men, over some
  greater, over some less: on those greater who sin more, on those less who
  sin in less degree. Now the devil by his wiles causes miserable men to
  fall sick, and instigates them to believe in an idol: then ceases he from
  afflicting them, and has their souls in his power; then they say to the
  image, Thou art my god. But the devil, which was within your temple, is
  bound, and cannot answer those who pray to him. If thou wilt prove
  whether I speak truth, I will command <!-- Page 463 --><span

  "Why hast thou corrupted my brother with thy magic?" Bartholomew
  answered, "I have not corrupted him, but I have turned him from

  might crush the vain image in which they dwelt, that mankind might turn
  from their errors, and believe in the true God." Then said the king, "So

  believed and were baptized at the hands of the mass-priests whom the

  episcopal order; and the servants of God and the believing people chose
  him unanimously to that order. It happened then, after the ordination,

  <p>We may take example by the apostolic doctrine, that no christian man
  shall fetch his salvation save from the Almighty Creator, whom life and
  death, sickness and health obey, who hath said in his gospel, that a
  little bird falls not in death without God's direction. He is so mighty,
  that he directs and orders without toil; but he scourges his chosen with
  diseases, as he himself said, "Those whom I love I chastise and scourge."
  For divers causes are christian men afflicted with disease, sometimes for
  their sins, sometimes for trial, sometimes for God's miracles, sometimes
  for preservation of good courses, that they may be the humbler; but in
  all these things patience is needful. Sometimes also through God's
  vengeance comes very dreadful evil to the impious man, so that his
  punishment begins in this world, and his soul departs to eternal
  punishments for his cruelty; as Herod who slew the <!-- Page 473 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page473"></a>{473}</span>innocent children at
  the birth of Christ, and many others besides him. If the sinful be
  afflicted with disease for his unrighteousness, then if he with patience
  praise his Lord, and pray for his mercy, he shall be washed from his sins
  by that sickness, as a foul garment by soap. If he be righteous, he shall
  have greater honour through his sickness, if he be patient. He who is
  impatient, and with froward mind murmurs against God in his sickness,
  shall have double condemnation, for he increases his sins by that
  murmuring, and suffers nevertheless.</p>

  <p>This Herod, who commanded John to be beheaded, and agreed with Pilate
  the ealdorman in the suffering of Jesus, and delivered him to his
  judgement, was the son of the other Herod, who reigned at the time when
  Christ was born; for it was usual at that time for rich men to give their
  children names after themselves, that it might seem the greater
  remembrance of the father, when the son, his heir, was called by his
  father's name. The cruel father, Herod, left five sons; three he
  commanded to be slain in his last illness, ere he departed. Then he died
  miserably and suddenly after he had slain the children on account of the
  birth of Christ; when Archelaus his son succeeded to the kingdom. Then
  after a space of ten years he was driven from his throne, because the
  Jewish people complained of his pride to the emperor, and he then sent
  him into exile. The emperor then divided the Jewish kingdom into four,
  and placed therein four brothers, who, according to the Greek tongue, are
  called 'tetrarchs,' that is, <i>rulers over a fourth</i>. A tetrarch is
  he who has a fourth part of a kingdom. One of these brothers was called
  Philip, who took to wife the daughter of the king Arethe, of an Arabian
  people, who was called Herodias. Then after some time they, Philip and
  Arethe, were at variance, and he took his daughter from his son-in-law,
  and gave her to his brother Herod; because he was greater in fame and in
  power. Herod then cast off his lawful wife, and adulterously lived in
  criminal union.</p>

  <p>Then at that time John the Baptist preached God's righteousness to all
  the Jewish people, and reproved Herod for that foul union. Ecclesiastica
  Historia ita narrat: When Herod saw that all the Jewish multitude ran to
  John's teaching, and zealously obeyed his admonitions, he was afraid,
  <!-- Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page481"></a>{481}</span>and imagined that through John's teaching
  they would despise his government, and would anticipate them, and brought
  him into prison in a town which is called Machæruntia. John sent then two
  disciples from the prison to Christ, and inquired of him, thus saying,
  "Art thou he who is to come, or are we to await another?" As though he
  had said, Manifest to me whether thou thyself wilt descend to the inmates
  of hell for the redemption of men, as I have preached to the world that
  thou wast to come,&mdash;manifest. Jesus then, at the same time as the
  evangelist Luke wrote, was healing many sick from divers diseases, and
  giving reason to insane men, and sight to the blind, and said then to
  John's messengers, "Go now to John, and make known to him the things
  which ye have seen and heard. Behold now blind see, and the halt go, and
  lepers are cleansed, deaf hear, and the dead arise, and poor preach the
  gospel; and he is happy who shall not be offended in me." As though he
  had said to John, Such wonders I work, and yet will I perish by death for
  the redemption of mankind, and follow thee dying, and happy shall he be
  who now praiseth my wonders, if he despise not my death, and on account
  of that death doubt not that I am God. Thus Jesus revealed to John that
  he himself would vouchsafe to die, and afterwards visit the inmates of
  hell.</p>

  <p>Then meanwhile it befell that Herod, as we before said, feasted his
  councillors on the day on which he was born; for at that time they had
  great rejoicing on their birth-tides. The daughter then, as we before
  said, played with her maidens at the feast, to the pleasure of them all,
  and the father then promised on oath that he would give her whatsoever
  she desired. Of three impious sins we have heard,&mdash;the unholy
  celebration of his birth-tide, and the giddy dancing of the maiden, and
  the father's presumptuous oath. These <!-- Page 483 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page483"></a>{483}</span>three things it
  befitteth us to oppose in our conduct. We may not with vain celebrations
  turn our birth-tide to any holyday, nor have our birth in such
  remembrance; but we should anticipate our last day with penitence and
  penance, so as it is written, "In all things be thou mindful of thy last
  day, and thou wilt sin not to eternity." It is not fitting to us to
  pollute our body, which is hallowed to God in the salutary baptism, with
  indecent and foolish play; for our bodies are limbs of God, as St. Paul
  said, "And he enjoined, that we should prepare our bodies as a living and
  holy sacrifice, and acceptable to God." The body is a living sacrifice
  which is shielded against deadly sins, and through holy virtues is
  acceptable to God and holy. God himself forbids every oath to christian
  men, thus saying, "Swear thou not by heaven, for it is God's throne.
  Swear thou not by earth, for it is God's footstool. Swear thou not by
  thine own head, for thou canst not make one hair of thy locks white or
  black. I say unto you, swear ye not by anything, but be your speech thus
  ended, It is as I say, or it is not so. Whatsoever there is more by oath,
  that is of evil."</p>

  <p>Christ himself confirmed his speech, when he spake to a Samaritan
  woman with these words, "Crede mihi," that is, "Believe me." Yet if we
  anywhere heedlessly swear, and the oath compel us to a worse deed, then
  will it be more advisable for us to avoid the greater guilt, and atone to
  God for the oath. David, for example, swore by God that he would slay the
  foolish man Nabal, and destroy all his things; but at the first
  intercession of the prudent woman Abigail, he returned his sword into the
  sheath, and praised the woman's prudence, who forbade him that perilous
  murder. Herod through folly swore that he would give the dancing daughter
  whatsoever she might ask: then, because he would <!-- Page 485 --><span

  perjurer by his guests, he stained the feast with blood, and gave the
  death of the great prophet to the lewd dancer in reward of her play. Much
  better for him had it been to have broken the oath, than to have
  commanded such a prophet to be slain.</p>

  flee from the greater guilt by the outlet of the less, as he does who

  lowest, and there darts over. But Herod, when he would not, through
  John's remonstrance, turn from the unclean connexion, fell into murder,
  and the smaller sin was the cause of the greater, so that he for his foul
  adultery, which he well knew was hateful to God, shed the prophet's
  blood, who he knew was acceptable to God. This is the sentence of the
  divine judgement, by which it is said, "Let him who injureth, injure yet
  more; and let him who liveth in foulness, defile himself yet more." This
  sentence befell the cruel Herod. Now there is another sentence shortly
  said concerning good men, "Let him who is holy be yet more hallowed."
  This befell the Baptist John, who was holy through manifold deserts; and
  was yet more hallowed, when he through the preaching of truth came to

  <p>The historian Josephus wrote in the ecclesiastical history, that the
  cruel Herod, a little while after the death of John, ruled his kingdom,
  but first for his wicked deeds his army was slain in battle, and himself
  afterwards driven from his kingdom, and sent into exile, by a very
  righteous judgement, when he would not listen to John's exhortations to
  eternal life, that he suddenly with disgrace should lose his transitory
  kingdom. The wise Augustine exhorts us with these words, and says,
  "Consider, I pray you, my brethren, with understanding, how wretched is
  this present life, and yet ye dread leaving it too speedily. Ye love this
  life in which ye exist with toil; thou carest about thy need; thou
  runnest, and art filled with anxiety; thou ploughest, and sowest, and

  on sea and on land, and shalt end all these aforesaid things, and also
  thy life with tribulation. Learn now, therefore, that ye may be able to
  earn the eternal life, in which ye will suffer none of these toils, but

  <p>In this life we faint, if we sustain not ourselves with food; if we
  drink not, we are destroyed by thirst; if we watch too long, we faint; if
  we stand long, we are fatigued, and then sit; again, if we sit too long,
  our limbs sleep. Consider <!-- Page 491 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page491"></a>{491}</span>also after this, that there is no
  stability of our body: childhood passes to boyhood, and boyhood to full
  growth; full growth bows to age, and age is ended by death. Verily our
  age stands on no stability, but so much as the body grows so greatly are
  its days diminished. Everywhere in our life are faintness and weariness,
  and decay of the body, and yet every one desires that he may live long.
  What is to live long but long to toil? It happens to few men in these
  days to live eighty years in health, and whatsoever he lives over that,
  it is toil to him and pain, as the prophet said, "Evil are our days," and
  the worse that we love them. So this world flatters very many, that they
  are unwilling to end this life of exile. A true and blessed life it will
  be, when we from death arise and reign with Christ. In that life will be
  good days, yet not many days, but one, which knows no rise nor no ending,
  which no tomorrow follows, because no yesterday preceded it; but the one
  day will for ever be unended without any night, without afflictions,
  without all the toils, which we a little before in this lecture
  recounted. This day and this life are promised to righteous christians,
  to whom may the merciful Lord lead us, who liveth and reigneth with the
  Father and the Holy Ghost ever without end. Amen.</p>

  Page 493 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page493"></a>{493}</span>'inundation' or 'agitation.' The dead
  youth, who was borne in sight of many men, betokens every sinful man who
  in the inward man is fordone with deadly sins, and his evilness is known
  to men. The youth was the only-born son of his mother, so is also every
  christian man spiritually a son of the holy church, which is the mother
  of us all, and, nevertheless, an undefiled maiden; for her family is not
  bodily but spiritual. Every servant of God, when he learns, is called a
  child: afterwards, when he teaches another, he is a mother, as the
  apostle Paul said of the fallen men, "Ye are my children, whom I now a
  second time conceive, until Christ is renewed in you." The port-gate
  betokens some bodily sense through which men sin. The man that sows
  dissension among christian men, or who speaks unrighteousness in high
  places through his mouth's gate, he is borne dead. He who beholds a woman
  with libidinous eye and foul lust, through his eyes' gate, manifests his
  soul's death. He who with delight hears idle discourse or contumelious
  words, makes his ear a gate of death to himself. So is it also to be
  understood of the other senses.</p>

  <p>Jesus was moved with compassion for the mother, that he might give us
  an example of his piety; and he afterwards raised the dead, that he might
  confirm us to his faith. He approached and touched the bier, and the
  biermen stood still. The bier which bare the dead is the heedless mind of
  the hopeless sinful. But the bearers, who bare him to the grave, are the
  blandishments of flattering companions, who with blandishment and
  envenomed suavities stimulate and praise the sinful, as the prophet said,
  "The sinful is praised in his lusts, and the unrighteous is blessed: when
  he is surrounded by empty fame and flatteries, then is it as though he
  were overwhelmed by a mould-heap." Of such Jesus said to one of his
  chosen, when he would bury his father's corpse: he said, "Allow the dead
  to bury their dead: go thou, and <!-- Page 495 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page495"></a>{495}</span>preach God's kingdom."
  Verily the dead bury other dead, when sinful men court others their like
  with pernicious praise, and oppress with the accumulated weight of the
  worst flattery. Of such it is said in another place, "The tongues of
  flatterers bind the souls of men in sins."</p>

  <p>When the Lord touched the bier, the biermen stood still. So also, if
  the mind of the sinful is touched by fear of the heavenly doom, then he
  withstands evil lusts and false flatteries, and to the Lord calling to
  eternal life promptly answers, as if he had arisen from death. The Lord
  said to the youth, "I say unto thee, Arise. And he forthwith sat and
  spake, and Jesus delivered him to his mother." The requickened sits, when
  the sinful with divine stimulation quickens. He speaks, when he employs
  his mouth with God's praises, and with true confession seeks God's mercy.
  He is delivered to his mother, when through the priest's authority he is
  associated in communion of the holy church. The folk was astonished with
  great awe; for so as a man turns from great sins to God's mercy, and
  corrects his conduct after God's commandments, so more men will be turned
  through his example to the praise of God.</p>

  <p>The Lord when he raised the stinking Lazarus was troubled and shed
  tears, and with a loud voice cried, "Lazarus, go forth:" he then
  manifested that he who has very long and habitually sinned, shall also
  with great repentance and weeping turn his evil habits to God's
  righteousness. There is no sin so great that a man may not expiate it,
  if, with inward heart, according to the degree of the sin, he continue in
  true penitence. There is, nevertheless, great disquisition concerning one
  sentence which Christ said: he said, "Every sin and calumny shall be
  forgiven to repenting men, but calumny of the Holy Ghost shall never be
  forgiven. Though any one speak a calumnious word against me, he shall be
  forgiven, if he do penance; but he who says a word against the Holy
  Ghost, shall not be forgiven in this world nor in that to come." There is
  no forgiveness of sins but through the Holy Ghost. There is one Almighty
  Father, who begot a Son of himself. The Father is not called Father in
  common from the Son and the Holy Ghost, for the latter is not the son of
  them both. But the Holy Ghost is called in common from the Father and the
  Son, for he is the Spirit of them both, that is the Love and Will of them
  both, through whom sins are forgiven. Verily the work of the Holy Trinity
  <!-- Page 501 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>To many men is known the holy place of St. Michael, on the mountain
  which is called Garganus. The mountain stands on the borders of the land
  of Campania, towards the Adriatic sea, twelve miles in ascent from a town
  which is called Sepontina. From that place originated this day's festival
  throughout the faithful church. There dwelt a very rich man called
  Garganus: from his adventure the mountain was so named. It happened when
  the immense multitude of his cattle was grazing on the mountain, that an
  unruly bull wandered alone and despised the drove. Hereupon the master
  Garganus gathered a great many of his household servants, and sought the
  bull everywhere in the waste, and at last found him standing on the knoll
  of the high mountain, at the entrance of a cavern; and he was then moved
  with anger, because the solitary bull had despised his herd, and bent his
  bow, and would shoot him with a poisoned arrow; but the poisoned arrow
  turned back as if thrown by the wind's blast, and instantly slew him who
  had shot it.</p>

  advisable, that they should ask from God an explanation of the miracle
  with a fast of three days. On the third night of the fast the archangel
  Michael appeared to the bishop in a ghostly vision, thus saying, "Wisely
  ye did to seek at God that which was hidden to men. Know thou for
  certain, that the man who was shot with his own arrow, that it was done

  then on the morrow blithe and free from care, through the angel's
  promise, and with confidence in his succour, marched against the heathen.
  Then immediately at the beginning of the fight the mount Garganus was
  trembling with immense quaking, and great lightning flew from the
  mountain as it were arrows against the heathen folk, and the knoll of the
  mount was all overhung with dark clouds. Whereupon the heathen with
  affrighted mind took to flight, and at the same time that they were shot
  with fiery arrows, they <!-- Page 507 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  weapons of the christians, until half-dead they sought their city Naples.
  But those who escaped from those perils, acknowledged that God's angel
  came to the succour of the christians, and they straightways subjected
  their necks to Christ, and became armed with his faith. Verily in that
  slaughter there were counted six hundred men shot with the fiery arrows.
  The christians then victorious returned home with great confidence and
  joy, and brought their promise to the temple to Almighty God and his
  archangel Michael. Then saw they before the north door of the church, on
  the marble stone, as it were a man's footsteps, firmly impressed on the
  stone, and they then understood that the archangel Michael would manifest
  that token of his presence. They then forthwith raised a church and an
  altar thereover, to the praise of the archangel, who had stood in that
  place succouring them.</p>

  raised a church in the east part of the place, and hallowed it to the
  honour of the apostle Peter, and therein placed an altar to St. Mary and
  John the Baptist. Then at last the bishop sent to the pope, and asked
  him, how they were to do concerning the archangel's structure. To this
  errand the pope answered thus, "If it is allowed to men to hallow the
  church which the archangel himself constructed, then the hallowing ought
  to be on the day on which, through the grace of the Almighty, he gave you
  victory. But if aught else should be pleasing to the archangel, ask his
  will on the same day." When this answer was announced to the bishop, he
  enjoined to his fellow-citizens a fast of three days, and prayed to the
  Holy Trinity that some certain sign might be shown him concerning their
  doubt. The archangel Michael then, on the third night of the fast, said
  to the bishop in a dream, "There is no need for you to hallow the church
  which I have constructed. I <!-- Page 509 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page509"></a>{509}</span>myself constructed and hallowed it. But go
  into the church fearlessly, and in my presence visit the place according
  to custom with prayers; and do thou sing mass there to-morrow, and let
  the people, after the divine rites, go to housel; and I will then show
  how I through myself hallowed the place."</p>

  <p>They then straightways on the morrow went joyfully thither with their
  offerings, and with great unity of their prayers went in on the south
  part. Lo then they saw a long portico on the north part stretching very
  near to the marble stone, on which the angel standing had manifested his
  foot-marks. On the east part was seen a great church to which they step
  by step ascended. The church with its portico could easily contain in its
  space five hundred men: and there stood, placed against the middle of the
  south wall, a venerable altar covered with a red pall. That house was not
  constructed after the fashion of men, but had divers towers at the
  corners, in likeness of a cave. The roof also was of various height: in
  one place a man might reach it with his head, in another hardly with his
  hand. I believe that the archangel would thereby manifest that he much
  more sought and loved cleanness of heart than the adornment of stones.

  <p>But after the mass and the holy housel every one with great joy
  returned to his own. The bishop then placed God's servants there,
  singers, and readers, and priests, that they might daily there perform
  God's service in a fitting manner; and commanded a monastic house to be
  there built for them. There is, however, no man daring to that degree
  that he dares to come within the church in the night-time, but at dawn,
  when God's servants are singing God's praise therein. From the roof-stone
  on the north part of the holy altar there runs drop by drop water very
  pure and sweet, which those who dwelt in the place called 'stilla,' that
  is <i>drop</i>. There is <!-- Page 511 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  which receives the pleasant fluid. It is the people's wont, after the

  fluid. The fluid is very pleasant of taste, and very salutary to the
  touch. Verily very many after a tedious fever and divers sicknesses, by
  drinking this fluid, speedily enjoy their health. Also in another manner,
  innumerable sick are there often and frequently healed, and many
  miracles, through the archangel's power, are there performed; but chiefly
  on this day, when the people from every nation visit the place, and the
  angel's presence is there in some measure most sensible, that the words
  of the apostle may be bodily fulfilled, that which he spake spiritually:
  he said, that "angels shall be sent as ministering spirits from God
  hither into the world, that they may be for a succour to his chosen, that
  they may receive the eternal country with him."</p>

  the child was which he called to him. A meek child desires not other
  men's possessions, nor a beauteous woman; though it be vexed it holds no
  lasting animosity towards those who injured it, nor feigns it with words,

  <p>Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, ye shall not come to the kingdom
  of heaven, unless ye are changed and become as children." He did not
  enjoin to his disciples that they should be children in body, but that
  they should hold the innocence of meek children in their conduct. In one
  place he said, when a child was brought to him to be blessed, and his
  disciples reproved it, "Suffer these children to come unto me, for of
  such is the kingdom of heaven." Of this the apostle Paul admonished his
  followers, and said, "Be ye not children in understanding, but in
  evilnesses: be perfect in understanding." Jesus said, "Whosoever humbleth
  himself like this child, he shall be first in the kingdom of heaven." Let
  us have true humility in our lives, if we will have high dignity in God's
  kingdom, as Jesus said, "Every one of those who exalt themselves shall be
  humbled, and he who humbleth himself shall be exalted." He has the
  innocence of a meek child, who is displeasing to himself that he may <!--
  Page 515 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page515"></a>{515}</span>be
  pleasing to God; and he will be so much the fairer in the sight of God as
  he shall be the more humble before himself. "He who receives one such
  little one in my name, receives myself." To all God's poor we should
  minister benefactions, though above all to the humble and meek, who in
  their life's conduct conform to the commandments of Christ; for he will
  be served by serving his poor, and he himself will be received by
  receiving them.</p>

  <p>He said also in another place, "He who receiveth a prophet shall have
  a prophet's meed; he who receiveth a righteous man shall have a righteous

  of God, and provides sustenance for him for love of God, shall then have
  as great a meed from God for his bounty, as if he himself were a prophet,
  or a righteous servant of God. "He who offends one of these little ones,
  who believe in me, better were it for him that an immense millstone were
  tied to his neck, and he were so sunk in the deep sea." He offends
  another who deceives him on the part of God, so that his soul be lost.
  The millstone which turns incessantly, and accomplishes no course,
  betokens love of the world, which circulates in errors, and fixes no step
  in the way of God. Of such the prophet said, "The wicked turn in a
  circle." He who enters upon a holy order in God's church, and afterwards
  by instigation or by sinful life gives evil example to others, and
  perverts their understanding, then better were it for him that he alone
  perished in his worldly life, than that he in holy guise should draw
  others with him to perdition through his depraved morals.</p>

  love this perishable world more than everlasting life, and with divers
  offences pervert themselves and others. "It is needful that offences

  with errors, that it cannot be without offences, and yet wo to the man
  who <!-- Page 517 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  his life, and for him it shall be worse, who with evil instigation
  deceives another man's soul to eternal destruction. "If thine hand or thy
  foot offend thee, cut off the limb, and cast it from thee." This is said
  according to a spiritual signification, not as a bodily precept. God
  commanded no man to destroy his limbs. The hand betokens our needful
  friend, who with work and succour daily ministers to our need; but yet,
  if such friend entice us from the way of God, then will it be better for
  us that we cut off from us his fleshly love, and by separation cast it
  away, than that we, through his evil instigation, together with him fall
  into eternal perdition. So is it also with the foot and the eye. If any
  relation be as dear to thee as thine eye, and another as needful to thee
  as thy hand, and one as serviceable as thy own foot, if they then
  perversely instigate thee to thy soul's destruction, better will it be
  for thee that thou shun their fellowship, than that they lead thee on
  with them to eternal perdition. "Take heed that ye despise no one of
  these little ones." He who deceives one of God's servants angers the
  Lord, as he himself through his prophet said, "He who toucheth you, it

  said of every righteous man, "God hath commanded his angels concerning
  thee, that they may preserve thee, and lift thee in their hands, lest

  <p>The Old Law informs us that archangels are set over every nation, that
  they may take care of the people, over the other angels, as Moses, in the
  fifth book of the Old Law, manifested in these words, "When God on high
  divided and scattered Adam's offspring, he set the boundaries of nations
  according to the number of his angels." In this sense agrees the prophet
  Daniel in his prophecy. An angel of God spake to Daniel concerning the
  archangel who directed the Persian people, and said, "The archangel came
  to me, the prince of the Grecian people, and there is none of these my
  supporter, save Michael, the prince of the Hebrew folk. Lo, Michael, one
  of the first princes, came to me in succour, and I continued there with
  the king of the Persian nation." By these words is manifested how great
  care the archangels have of their authority over mankind, when he said
  that Michael came to his succour.</p>

  <p>My dearest brothers, I have frequently told you, that everywhere in
  the holy gospel this present church is called the kingdom of heaven.
  Verily a gathering of righteous men is called the kingdom of heaven. God
  said through his prophet, "Heaven is my seat." Paul the Apostle said that
  "Christ is God's Might and God's Wisdom." Clearly we may understand that
  the soul of every righteous man is heaven, when Christ is God's Wisdom,
  and the soul of a righteous man is the seat of wisdom, and heaven is his
  seat. Of this the psalmist said, "The heavens make known the glory of
  God." He calls the heavens God's messengers. But the congregation of holy
  men is the kingdom of heaven, because their hearts are not occupied in
  earthly desires, but they sigh for that which is above; and God now long
  since reigns in them, as in the heavenly dwellings.</p>

  <p>"The king went in, and beheld the guests, when he saw one man there
  who was not clad in a marriage garment." The marriage garment betokens
  the true love of God and men. That love our Creator manifested to us in
  himself, when he vouchsafed to redeem us from eternal death with his
  precious blood, as John the Evangelist said, "So greatly God loved this
  world, that he gave his only-begotten Son for us." The Son of God, who
  through love came to men, signified in the gospel that which the marriage
  garment betokened,&mdash;true love. Every of those who with faith and
  baptism incline to God, comes to the marriage; but he comes not with a
  marriage garment, if he holds not true love. For ye see that everyone is
  ashamed, if he is invited to a worldly marriage, to come meanly clad to
  that short pleasure; but a much greater shame is it for him who with a
  sordid garment comes to God's marriage, so that for his foul habit he
  shall be cast from eternal bliss into eternal darkness. So as a garment
  adorns a man bodily, so also true love adorns our soul with spiritual
  fairness. Though a man have full faith, and give alms, and do much good,
  all will be vain, whatsoever he does, unless he have true love for God
  and for all christian men. It is true love, that everyone love his friend
  well, and his foe for his good. The Heavenly King goes daily to the
  marriage, that is, into his church, and looks whether we are clad within
  in the marriage garment; and whomsoever he finds without <!-- Page 531
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page531"></a>{531}</span>true love, him
  he questions with wrath, thus saying, "Thou friend, how durstest thou
  come to my preparation without a marriage garment?" "Friend" he called
  him, and, nevertheless, cast him from his guests. A friend he was through
  faith, and a reprobate in works. He was forthwith silent, because at
  God's doom there is no exculpation nor defence; for the Judge who
  convicts without, is cognizant of his mind within. Though any one have
  not true love perfectly, yet should he not despair of himself, for of
  such the prophet spake to God, "My Lord, thine eyes have seen my
  imperfections, and in thy book all] are written."</p>

  give nothing to the poor, shall then be bound in torment; because they

  darkness is the swart night of eternal condemnation. The condemned will
  then by compulsion suffer in outer darkness, because he now wilfully
  passes his life in blindness of heart, and has no remembrance of the true
  light, that is, Christ, who said of himself, "I am the light of the

  There the eyes shall weep in the hellish flame, which now libidinously
  roll about with unallowed desires; and the teeth, which now rejoice in
  gluttony, shall there grate in the unspeakable torments, which are

  <p>St. Gregory now says, that a certain brother entered into a monastery
  which he himself had founded, and after regular probation received
  monkhood. A fleshly brother followed him to the monastery, not for desire
  of a good life, but for fleshly love. The ghostly brother, through his
  good life, was exceedingly liked by the monks of the monastery; and his
  fleshly brother with perverseness greatly contradicted <!-- Page 535
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page535"></a>{535}</span>the usages of
  his life. He lived in the monastery rather from necessity than for
  bettering. He was idle of speech, and perverse in deeds; appearing well
  in raiment, and evil in morals. He had no patience, if any one exhorted
  him to a good course. Hence was his life very irksome to the brothers,
  but they endured it calmly on account of his brother's goodness. He could
  do nothing good, nor would he hear any good. He was then suddenly seized
  with some disease, and brought to death. When he was raised up for
  departure, the brothers came that they might pray for his soul. He lay
  chilled in his lower limbs: in his breast alone the spirit yet breathed.
  The brothers then prayed for him the more fervently, the more they saw
  that he would quickly depart. He then suddenly cried, thus saying,
  "Depart from me. Lo here is a dragon come which is to swallow me, but he
  cannot for your presence. He has seized my head in his jaws. Give place
  to him, that he may no longer afflict me. If I am given to this dragon to
  be swallowed, why should I suffer delay through your presence?"</p>

  <p>We should not be hopeless, though in this present church many are evil
  and few good; for Noah's ark on the waves of the great flood was a type
  of this church, and it was in the lower part wide and in the upper
  narrow. In the lowermost bottom dwelt the fierce beasts and creeping
  worms. On the second flooring dwelt birds and clean animals. On the third
  flooring dwelt Noah with his wife, and his three sons with their three
  wives. In the bottom the ark was roomy, where the fierce beasts dwelt,
  and narrowed above, where the dwelling of men was; for the holy church is
  in fleshly men very broad, and in spiritual narrow. She spreads her bosom
  where the rugged dwell in brutal habits, and she is narrowed at the end
  which the discreet inhabit, living in spiritual practices; for the holier
  they are in this present church, so the less of them there is. Much more
  is there of those men who live for their own lusts, than there is of
  those who regulate their life's actions after the commandments of God:
  yet is the number of holy men ever increased through the diminution of
  impious men. The number of God's chosen is not little, as Christ said in
  another place, "Many shall come from the east part and from the west, and
  shall sit with the patriarch Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom
  of heaven." Again, the psalmist said of God's chosen, "I counted them,
  and their number is greater than the sand-grains." In this present life
  the chosen appear few in comparison with the number of the reprobates,
  but when they shall be gathered to the eternal life, their number will be
  so manifold, that it will exceed, according to the prophet's saying, the
  number of the sand-grains.</p>

  <p>But some of those holy spirits, who continued with their Creator, come
  sent to us, and announce future things. Some of them, by God's direction,
  work signs and frequently miracles in the world. Some of them are chiefs
  set over other angels for the fulfilment of the divine mysteries. Through
  some God establishes and decides his dooms. Some are so closely
  associated with God, that no others are between them, and they are then
  burning in so much greater love, as they more clearly behold the
  brightness of God. Now is this day piously hallowed to these angels, and
  also to those holy men, who through great excellences have thriven to God
  from the beginning of the world. Of these were first the patriarchs,
  religious and glorious men in their lives, the fathers of the prophets,
  whose memory shall not be forgotten, and their names shall last for ever,
  because they were acceptable to God through faith, and righteousness, and
  obedience. These were followed by the chosen company of prophets: they
  held speech with God, and to them he manifested his secrets, and
  enlightened them with the grace of the Holy Ghost, so that they knew the
  things to come, and announced them in prophetic song. Verily the chosen
  prophets by many signs and foretokens were in their lives illustrious.
  They healed the sickness of men, and the bodies of dead men they raised
  to life. They also, for the people's perversity, withdrew the showers of
  heaven, and again in mercy permitted them. They bewailed the people's
  sins, and their punishment prevented on themselves. Christ's humanity,
  and his passion, and resurrection, and ascension, and the great doom,
  instructed by the Holy Ghost, they prophesied.</p>

  "Among the children of women there hath arisen no greater man than is

  instructed them in right belief and true doctrine, and set them as

  good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven. Ye are my friends,
  and I make known unto you whatsoever I have heard from my Father." Verily
  the Lord gave power to his twelve apostles to work the same wonders which
  he himself performed in the world. And whatsoever they bind on earth,
  that shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever they unbind on earth, that
  shall be unbound in heaven. He also promised them with a true promise,

  sunk in the wide sea, others flayed alive, others torn with iron claws,
  some overwhelmed with stones, some afflicted with winterly cold, some

  immortality, though before men they were tormented. They were for a short

  <p>The wise Augustine expounded this gospel, and said, that the mount
  which Jesus ascended betokens the high commandments of true
  Righteousness: the less commandments were appointed for the Jewish folk.
  One God, nevertheless, appointed, through his holy prophets, the less
  commandments to the Jewish nation, which was yet bound by fear; and he
  appointed, through his own Son, the greater commandments for the
  christian folk, whom he with true love came to redeem. He taught sitting:
  that belongs to the dignity of teachership. His disciples approached him,
  that they might be nearer bodily, who with mind approached to his
  commandments. Jesus opened his mouth. Verily he opened his mouth to the
  evangelic lore, who in the old law was wont to open the mouths of the
  prophets. Yet the opening of his mouth betokens the deep speech which he
  then drew forth. He said, "Blessed are the spiritual poor, for of them is
  the kingdom of heaven." Who are the spiritual poor but the humble, who
  have awe of God, and have no <!-- Page 551 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page551"></a>{551}</span>arrogance? Awe of God is the beginning of
  wisdom, and pride is the beginning of every sin. Many are poor through
  indigence, and not in their spirit, because they desire to have much.
  There are also other poor, not through indigence but in spirit, because
  they are, according to the apostolic saying, "As having nought and
  possessing all things." In this way Abraham was poor, and Jacob, and
  David, who, raised on his throne, showed himself poor in spirit, thus
  saying, "I truly am poor and needy." The proud rich are not needy through
  indigence nor in spirit, for they are enriched with possessions and
  swelled up in mind. Poor through indigence and in spirit are those
  perfect monks, who for God so completely forsake all things, that they
  will not have their own bodies in their power, but live by direction of
  their ghostly teacher; and therefore as much as they here for God
  continue in indigence, so much will they be hereafter enriched in the
  glory to come.</p>

  <p>"Rejoice and be glad, for your meed is manifold in heaven." It befits
  the faithful to glory in tribulations, for tribulation works patience,
  and patience trial, and trial hope. But hope is never confounded, because
  the love of God is poured into our hearts, by the Holy Ghost who is given
  to us. Of this spake the apostle James, "O ye my brothers, hope for
  yourselves every bliss, when ye are in divers temptations, for the trial
  of your faith is much more precious than gold which has been tried by
  fire." Again, holy writ says, "Vessels of clay are tried in a furnace,
  and righteous men in the affliction of their temptation." Of these said
  Jesus also <!-- Page 557 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page557"></a>{557}</span>in another place to his disciples, "If
  this world hate you, know ye that it hated me before you; and if they
  persecuted me, then will they also persecute you." Christ himself was
  slain by impious men, and so also his disciples and martyrs; and all
  those who desire to live religiously in the faithful church shall suffer
  persecution, either from the invisible devil or from visible impious
  limbs of the devil: but these transitory persecutions or tribulations we
  should with joy undergo for Christ's name, because he has thus promised
  to all the patient, "Exult and rejoice, behold your meed is manifold in
  heaven."</p>

  <p>This holy man Clement, whom we honour on this present <!-- Page 559
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page559"></a>{559}</span>festival, was
  a disciple of the blessed apostle Peter. Then was he thriving in ghostly
  lore and study so greatly, that the apostle Peter chose him for pope of
  the Roman people after his day, and before his passion ordained him pope,
  and placed him in his episcopal seat, that he might have care of
  christian men. He had ordained two bishops previously, Linus and Clitus,
  but he did not place them in his seat, as he did this holy man, whom
  to-day we honour. Clement then after Peter's passion thrived in fairness
  of good morals, so that he was acceptable to Jews, and heathens, and
  christians together. He was liked by the heathen people, because he did
  not insult their gods with contumely, but with bookly reasoning
  manifested to them what they were, and where born whom they honoured as
  their gods, and showed to them, with manifest proofs, their lives and
  ends; and said that they themselves might easily attain to God's mercy,
  if they would wholly turn from their erroneous worship. The favour of the
  Jewish people he got, because he truly proved that their forefathers were
  called friends of God, and that God appointed them a holy law for their
  lives' direction; and said, that they would have been foremost in God's
  election, if with belief they had obeyed his commandments. By the
  christians he was most beloved, because he had all countries by name in
  his memory, and permitted not the indigent christians of those countries
  to be reduced to public mendicity, but by daily preaching he exhorted the
  rich and affluent to alleviate the poverty of the christians with their
  affluence, lest by the gifts of heathen men they should be corrupted.</p>

  great miracles so effectually, that the fierce heathen, as soon as they
  saw him, either falling sought his feet, obeying him and God, or if any
  one of them was hostile, he was seized with such great fear, that he
  straightways fled from his presence. Then was all the realm of the Franks

  the water-vein. Then Clement understood the lamb's beckoning, and said,
  "Open the earth in this place where the lamb beckoned." His companions
  fulfilled his command, and straightways at the first digging an immense
  wellspring sounded out, and ran forth in a great stream. Whereupon they

  angel came to him, and said, <!-- Page 573 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page573"></a>{573}</span>"Habakkuk, bear the meat to Babylon, and
  give it to Daniel, who sitteth in the lions' pit." Habakkuk answered the
  angel, "Sir, I never saw the city, nor know I the pit." Then the angel
  seized him by the hair, and bare him to Babylon, and set him above the
  pit. Then Habakkuk cried, "Thou servant of God, Daniel, take this gift
  which God hath sent thee." Daniel said, "My Lord Jesus, be to thee praise
  and honour, for that thou hast remembered me." And he then ate of the
  dish. And the angel of the Lord straightways brought the minister of
  food, Habakkuk, to the place whence he had before taken him. Then the
  king Cyrus on the seventh day went sad to the lions' pit, and looked in,
  and behold, there was Daniel sitting unhurt in the midst of the lions.
  Then the king cried with a loud voice, "Great is the God in whom Daniel
  believeth." And he then with that word drew him from the den, and ordered
  those to be cast in who before would fordo him. The king's command was
  quickly executed, and the prophet's persecutors were thrust among the
  lions, and they straightways with greedy jaws tore them all in pieces.
  Then said the king, "Let all dwellers on earth fear and dread the God of
  Daniel, for he is the Redeemer and Saviour, working signs and wonders in
  heaven and on earth."</p>

  <p>No earthly man may by writings make known, nor with tongue relate how
  often the Almighty Ruler has saved his chosen from divers perils, to the
  praise and honour of his majesty. But he very often allows the impious
  greatly to afflict his saints, sometimes with painful persecution,
  sometimes with slaying, that fierce persecution may end for the righteous
  in eternal rest, and for the murderers in eternal torment. The psalmist
  said, "Many are the tribulations of the righteous, but the Lord from all
  these will release them." In two ways God releases his chosen, openly and
  secretly. Openly they are released, when in sight of men they are saved,
  as we have now recounted to you. Secretly they are released, when through
  martyrdom they come to heavenly honours. If they suffer for true faith or
  for righteousness, they will then be martyrs. But if they are slain
  guiltless, their innocence will lead them to the fellowship of God's
  saints; for innocence ever continues secure. But if any one suffers
  persecution for sins, and knows himself, so that he <!-- Page 577
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page577"></a>{577}</span>inwardly pray
  for God's mercy, then will the transient punishment prevent eternal
  damnation. For crimes were the two thieves punished who were crucified
  with Christ, but one of them with great faith prayed to Christ, thus
  saying, "Lord, think of me when thou comest to thy kingdom." Christ
  answered him, "Verily I say unto thee, now to-day thou shalt be with me
  in the joy of paradise." Against our will we may lose the transitory
  good, but against our will we never lose the eternal good. Though the
  cruel robber bereave us of our property, or deprive us of life, he cannot
  take from us our faith or the eternal life, if we do not of our own will
  pervert ourselves. May the true Lord save us from all perils, and lead us
  to everlasting life, who liveth and reigneth ever without end. Amen.</p>

  <p>As they before with a net had fished on the sea waves, so Christ

  for they withdrew the people from fleshly lusts, and from worldly errors
  to the stability of the earth of the living, that is, to the eternal
  country, of which the prophet, through God's Spirit, said, "I will send
  my fishers, and they shall fish for them; my hunters, and they shall hunt
  them from every down and from every hill." Fishers and uneducated men the
  Lord chose to him for disciples, and so instructed them, that their lore
  excelled all worldly wisdom, and they by their preaching inclined
  emperors and <!-- Page 579 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  chosen at first eloquent teachers, and sent worldly philosophers, and the
  like to preach, then would it have appeared as if the true faith had not
  sprung up through God's might, but from worldly eloquence. He chose
  fishers ere he chose emperors, because it is better that the emperor,
  when he comes to Rome, cast aside his crown, and kneel at the fisher's
  memorial, than that the fisher kneel at the emperor's memorial. Emperors
  he chose, but yet he ranked the indigent fisher before the rich emperor.
  Afterwards he chose the wealthy; but it would have appeared as if they
  had been chosen for their possessions, if he had not previously chosen
  the needy. He then chose worldly philosophers, but they would have waxed
  proud, had he not before chosen the uneducated fishers.</p>

  <p>We read that at Christ's birth heavenly angels were seen above the
  born child, and that they with great delight sung this hymn, "Gloria in
  excelsis Deo, and in terra pax hominibus bonæ voluntatis:" that is in our
  tongue, "Be glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to those men
  who are of good will." No gift is so acceptable to God as good <!-- Page
  585 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page585"></a>{585}</span>will. If
  any one cannot obtain the means of offering a visible gift to God, let
  him offer an invisible one, that is, good will, which incomparably excels
  earthly treasures. What is good will but goodness, so that he grieves for
  another man's misfortune and rejoices in his prosperity; loves his friend
  not for the world, but for good; to bear with his foe with love, to
  command to no one that which he likes not himself, to help his
  neighbour's need according to his power, and to be willing beyond his
  power? What is any gift in comparison with this will, when the soul
  offers itself to God on the altar of its heart? Of this said the
  psalmist, "In me sunt, Deus, vota tua, quæ reddam laudationes tibi:" "God
  Almighty, in me are thy promises, which I will pay through praises." As
  if he had openly said, Though I have not outward gifts to offer unto
  thee, yet will I find in myself that which I may lay on the altar of thy
  praise; for thou livest not by our gift, but thou art more gladdened by
  the offering of our hearts. This offering cannot be in the heart which is
  occupied with covetousness or envy, for they are adverse to good will,
  and as soon as they touch the mind, the good will departs: therefore the
  holy preachers would desire nothing in this world with covetousness, nor
  have any separate possessions, to the end that they might without envy
  inwardly love each other.</p>

  the words of life, in wonders shining, and called them doves, and flying
  clouds. Our windows are our eyes, through which our soul beholds
  whatsoever it desires without. A dove is a meek animal, and a stranger to
  the bitterness of gall. Verily the holy apostles were as doves at their
  windows, when they <!-- Page 587 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>We have now in part run over the exposition of this gospel, now we
  will say to you the signification of the names of those four apostles,
  whom Christ first chose. Simon is interpreted <i>obedient</i>, and Peter
  <i>acknowledging</i>, Andrew <i>bold</i>, James is interpreted
  <i>withering</i>, and John <i>God's grace</i>: this signification every
  christian man should certainly hold in his life. Peter was called Simon
  before his conversion, but Christ called him Peter, which signifies
  <i>acknowledging</i>, because he acknowledged Christ with true belief,
  when he said, "Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God." Undoubtedly
  he who rightly acknowledges God, and obeys him, holds in his life the
  signification of these two names. If he boldly, for the name of God,
  endures hardship, and manfully withstands the temptations of the devil,
  then fulfils he in his conduct the signification of Andrew, which is
  interpreted <i>bold</i>. James is called <i>withering</i>, and he is
  truly withering, who with prudence withers his fleshly vices, and the
  instigation of the devil. John is interpreted <i>God's grace</i>. He is
  aptly called God's grace, who obtains the grace of God through good
  deserts, to the end that he may zealously fulfil his commandments.</p>

  <p>The apostle Andrew, after Christ's passion, went to the land which is
  called Achaia, and there preached the faith of the Lord, and the
  redemption of the world through his passion. Then Ægeas, a cruel judge,
  would suppress his preaching, and force the christians to idolatrous
  worship. Andrew said <!-- Page 589 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page589"></a>{589}</span>to him, "It were fitting, now thou art a
  judge of men, that thou shouldest know thy Judge who is in heaven, and
  worship him, who is the true God, and turn thy mind from the false gods."
  Ægeas answered him, "Art thou Andrew, who castest down the temples of our
  gods, and instigatest this people to the vain doctrine which the Roman
  senators have rejected, and ordered to be suppressed?" Andrew answered
  him, "The Roman senators know not yet God's truth, how the Son of God
  came to men, and taught that these idols which ye worship are not gods,
  but are the worst devils, foes of mankind, who teach men how they may
  exasperate the Almighty God, and he then forsakes them, and the devil
  deludes them so long, until they depart from their bodies guilty and
  naked, bearing nothing with them but sins alone." Ægeas said, "These are
  idle words; for when your Jesus preached these words, the Jews fastened
  him on a cross." Andrew answered him, "O, if thou wouldst know the
  mystery of the holy cross, with what discerning love the Prince of
  mankind received the cross for our re-establishment, not compelled, but
  of his own will." Ægeas said, "How sayest thou of his own will, when he
  was betrayed, and at the prayer of the Jews was crucified by the soldiers
  of the governor?" Andrew answered, "For this reason I said of his own
  will, because I was together with him when he was betrayed by his
  disciple, and he before his passion foretold it to us, and that on the
  third day he would arise from death: he said that he had power to give
  his soul, and power to receive it again." Ægeas said, "I wonder that
  thou, a sagacious man, wilt follow this doctrine, let it have been as it
  might, of his own will or by compulsion, that he was fastened on a
  cross." Andrew answered him, "Great is the mystery of the cross, which I
  will disclose to thee, if thou wilt hear me." Ægeas said, "It cannot
  truly be called a mystery, but a punishment." Andrew said, "That same
  punishment thou wilt understand to be the mystery of the <!-- Page 591
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page591"></a>{591}</span>renovation of
  mankind, if thou wilt patiently hear me." Ægeas answered, "I will hear
  thee patiently, but if thou obeyest me not, thou shalt receive the same
  mystery of the cross in thyself." Andrew answered him, "If I feared the
  cross, then would I not preach the glory of the cross." Ægeas said, "Thy
  witless speech preaches the punishment of the cross as a glory, because
  through audacity thou dreadest not the punishment of death." Andrew
  answered, "Not through audacity, but through faith I dread not the
  punishment of death. The death of righteous men is precious, and the
  death of sinful men is execrable." Ægeas said, "Unless thou offerest
  gifts to our almighty gods, on the same cross which thou praisest I will
  order thee afflicted to be fastened." Andrew said to him, "Daily I offer
  my gift to the Almighty God, who alone is the true God. Not flesh of
  lowing oxen, or blood of bucks, but I offer daily on the altar of the
  holy cross the undefiled lamb, and it continues sound and living after
  all folk have eaten its flesh, and drunk its blood." Ægeas asked, "How
  can that so be?" Andrew answered him, "If thou wilt learn how that can
  be, take a disciple's form, that thou mayest learn this mystery." <span
  class="correction" title="Original reads 'Egeas'.">Ægeas</span> said, "I
  will with torments extort from thee an insight into this matter." The
  holy apostle answered, "I wonder greatly at thee, how thou art turned to
  such great folly, that thou imaginest that for torments I will disclose
  to thee the divine mystery. Thou hast heard the mystery of the holy
  offering; now, if thou believest that Christ, the Son of God, who was
  hanged on a cross, is true God, then will I disclose to thee how the lamb
  continues sound and undefiled in its kingdom, after it is offered, and
  its flesh eaten, and its blood drunken. But if thou wilt not believe,
  thou wilt never come to an insight of this truth."</p>

  man hear his voice in the streets. Have now quiet and peace, and hinder
  not my martyrdom, but rather prepare yourselves, as God's soldiers, that
  ye with fearless mind may overcome all threats and bodily torments by
  patience. If any terror is to be dreaded, then is that to be dreaded
  which has no end. Verily awe of man is like smoke, and quickly, when it
  is agitated, vanishes. The pains in this world are either light and
  bearable, or they are heavy, and quickly drive out the soul. The pains
  which in the world to come are prepared for the evil, will be eternal;
  there will be daily weeping, and wailing, and groaning, and endless
  torment, to which Ægeas fearlessly hastens. Be rather ready, that through
  transitory tribulation ye may come to the eternal joy, where ye will ever
  rejoice, blooming and reigning with Christ."</p>

  <p>When the apostle had through all the night taught the folk in such
  words, Ægeas sent to the prison at dawn, and ordered the holy apostle to
  be led to him, and said, "I weened that thou in nightly meditation
  wouldst turn thy mind from folly, and cease from the praise of thy
  Christ, that thou mightest with us enjoy the delights of life. It is
  foolish that a man should hurry wilfully to the cross, and send himself
  to torments." Andrew answered, "Joy I may have with thee, if thou wilt
  believe in Christ and abandon thy idolatry. Christ sent me to this
  province, in which I have gained him no little folk." Ægeas said,
  "Therefore do I force thee to offer to our gods, that this folk, whom
  thou hast deceived, may forsake the vanity of thy lore, that they may
  offer to our gods a grateful sacrifice. Not a city has remained in all
  this country in which the temples of our gods have not been forsaken,
  <!-- Page 595 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page595"></a>{595}</span>and now the worship of our gods shall be
  again established through thee, that they may be gladdened in thee, and
  that thou mayst be in our friendship. If thou wilt not this, then shalt
  thou, for the security of our gods, suffer divers torments, and
  afterwards perish, hanging on the cross which thou hast praised." The
  apostle answered him, "Thou child of death, hear me, and thou chaff,
  prepared for everlasting kindling, hear me, God's servant, and apostle of
  Jesus Christ. Until now I have spoken to thee meekly, that thou with
  reason mightest acknowledge the true belief; but now thou persistest in
  thy shamelessness, and weenest that I shall fear for thy threats. Devise
  whatsoever appears to thee yet greater in torments. By so much the more
  acceptable I shall be to my King by as much as I for his name shall with
  profession continue in torments."</p>

  in Jesus, thou shalt have mercy, as I promised thee. If thou comest to
  release me, I will not be released hence living. Now I already see my

  canst do anything, lest thou desire when it is forbidden thee." They
  would then release him, but their hands stiffened, whosoever touched the

  <p>The apostle has excited us to arise at some time from the sleep of our
  sluggishness and disbelief, as ye in this present lesson have heard. "My
  brothers, know ye that it is now time for us to arise from sleep." Verily
  it befits us not to be always delicate in our faith, as a tender child,
  but we should hasten to perfect excellence through the observance of
  God's commandments. We should shake sluggish sleep from us, and forsake
  the devil's works, and go in the light, that is, in good works. Of old
  the light of knowledge shone over the circumference of earth, and very
  many shine in the way of truth, who go through the evangelic path to the
  joy of everlasting life. Lo now "our salvation is nearer than we
  believed." Through increasing knowledge and good will, salvation is
  nearer to every one than it was to him when he at first believed, and
  therefore he should ever increase in daily diligence, as the psalmist
  said of God's chosen, "The holy go from virtue to virtue."</p>

  name="page605"></a>{605}</span>presence, as the bright day drives away
  the dim darkness of the swart night. The devil is also called night, and
  Christ day, who has mercifully released us from the devil's darkness, and
  given us the light of knowledge and truth. "Let us cast away works of
  darkness, and be invested with weapons of light, so that we by day may go
  honestly." Let us by confession and repentance cast away the forthgone
  evils, and let us henceforth strongly withstand the instigations of the
  devil, as the same apostle in another place exhorted his followers,
  "Withstand the devil, and he will flee from you; draw near unto God, and
  he will draw near unto you." The weapons of light are works of
  righteousness and truth. With those weapons we should be invested, so
  that we by day may go honestly. As the light of day forbids everyone to
  perpetrate that which the night allows, so also the knowledge of truth,
  that is, the thought of our Lord's will, allows us not to perpetrate
  deeds of wickedness.</p>

  <p>We are ever seen by God, both without and within; therefore should
  everyone who wills not to be condemned especially take care that he
  transgress not God's commandments, either by gluttony or drunkenness. We
  should have ghostly refection, as the same apostle taught in these words,
  "When ye gather yourselves to refection, let each of you have salutary
  lore in mouth, and psalm-book in hand." Drunkenness is a death-bearing
  thing, and the material of libidinousness. Solomon said, "Nothing is
  secret where drunkenness reigns." In another place the same apostle
  bewailed the life of intemperate men, thus saying, "Their belly is their
  God, and their end is perdition, and their glory in pollution." Not in
  adulteries and uncleannesses, but let there be honourable union between
  believing persons, so that at least no adultery nor uncleanness be named
  in God's church; not in strife and envy. Christ said of peaceful men,
  that they are called children of God; and verily the strifeful are limbs
  of the devil. The evil ever seeks contention, and a cruel angel will <!--
  Page 607 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page607"></a>{607}</span>be
  sent against him. Envy is a pernicious vice, and ever will the envious be
  continuing in affliction, because envy blinds his mind and deprives it of
  every ghostly bliss. Through envy the devil deceived the first-created
  man, and the envious is a participator with the devils. True peace drives
  away discord, and enlightens the darkness of the mind, and envy certainly
  multiplies anger.</p>

  <p>Some of these signs we have seen accomplished, some we fear are to
  come. Verily in these new days nations have arisen against nations, and
  their affliction on earth has happened greater than we in old books read.
  Oft an earthquake in divers places has overthrown many cities, as it
  happened in the days of the emperor Tiberius, that thirteen cities fell
  through an earthquake. With pestilence and with hunger we are frequently
  afflicted, but we have not yet seen manifest signs in the sun, and in the
  moon, and in the stars. We read in astronomy, that the sun is sometimes
  darkened by the intervention of the lunar orb, and also the full moon
  suddenly becomes dusky, when it is deprived of the solar light <!-- Page
  611 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page611"></a>{611}</span>by the
  shadow of the earth. There are also some stars beamed with light,
  suddenly rising, and quickly departing, and they by their uprise ever
  indicate something new: but the Lord meant not these signs in the
  evangelical prophecy, but the awful signs which will precede the great
  day. Matthew the Evangelist wrote more plainly of these signs, thus
  saying, "Straightways after the great tribulation, the sun shall be
  darkened, and the moon shall give no light, and the stars shall fall from
  heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be agitated, and then shall appear
  the sign of Christ's cross in the heavens, and all earthly powers shall
  mourn." The minglings of the sea, and the sound of the waves have not yet
  unusually happened, but when many of the before-said signs have been
  fulfilled, there is no doubt that the few which are remaining will also
  be fulfilled.</p>

  <p>My brothers, these things are written that our minds may be vigilant
  through heedfulness, that through security they slacken not, nor through
  ignorance become void; but that terror ever occupy, and attention to good
  works confirm them. The Lord said, "Men shall wither for terror and for
  awaiting the things which shall come over all the world: for the powers
  of heaven shall be agitated." The powers of heaven are angels and
  archangels, thrones, principalities, lordships and powers. These hosts of
  angels will appear visible to our sights at the advent of the severe
  Judge, that they may sternly exact from us that which the invisible
  Creator patiently forbears. Then we shall see the Son of man coming in
  clouds, with great might and majesty. The Lord called himself the Son of
  man oftener than the Son of God, from the humility of his assumed
  humanity, that he may admonish us with the nature which he for us
  received. He is truly Son of man, and not Son of men, and there is no
  other son of one man but Christ alone. He will be manifested in might and
  in majesty to those who would not obey him while existing in humility,
  that they then may feel his <!-- Page 613 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page613"></a>{613}</span>might by so much the more severely as they
  now will not bow their necks to his patience. These words are said of the
  reprobates, but here follow the words which comfort the chosen. Jesus
  said, "When these wonders begin, then lift up your heads and behold, for
  your redemption approacheth." As if he had manifestly exhorted his
  chosen, 'When the torments of the world shall thicken, when the dread of
  the great doom shall appear, raise then your heads, that is, be glad in
  your minds, for then this world shall be ended, which ye loved not; then
  shall be at hand the redemption which ye sought.' In holy writ
  <i>head</i> is very frequently put for the mind of man, because the head
  directs the other members, as the mind devises the thoughts. We lift up
  our heads when we raise our minds to the joys of the heavenly country.
  Those whom God loves are exhorted to be glad for the ending of the world,
  for when that passes away, which they loved not, then certainly they will
  find that which they loved.</p>

  <p>What is this deathlike life but a way? Understand now what it is to
  faint through the toil of the way, and yet not to desire the way to end.
  The Lord said, "Behold these figtrees and all other trees, when they
  sprout, then ye know that summer is near. So likewise ye may know, when
  ye see these before-said signs, that God's kingdom draweth near." Verily
  by these words it is manifested that the fruit of this world is falling.
  It grows that it may fall; it sprouts that it may destroy with diseases
  whatsoever it had before sprouted. This world is like to a senescent man:
  in youth the body is thriving with strong breast, with full and hale
  limbs; but in senile years the man's stature is bowed, his neck
  slackened, his face wrinkled, and his limbs all afflicted; his breast is
  tormented with sighs, and between his words his breath fails; though
  disease sit not on him, yet too often his health is a disease to him. So
  it is with this world: at first it was thriving as in youth, it was
  growing in bodily health, and fat in abundance of good things, long in
  life, still in long peace; but now it is with age oppressed, as it were

  through decay, before this world ends. Of this sentence the apostle Paul
  said, that "the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the voice of
  the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead will first
  arise; afterwards, we who live, and shall be found in the body, will be
  caught forth with the others in clouds towards Christ, and so we shall
  ever after be with God. Comfort yourselves with these words." Also in
  this sentence the Evangelist Matthew agrees, in these words, "The Lord
  will send his angels with trumpet and loud voice, and they shall gather
  his chosen from the four winds, from all earthly boundaries to the high
  heavens."</p>

  <p>The apostle said, "We who live." He did not mean himself by those
  words, but those who continue in life until the ending of this world. By
  that it is likewise manifested, that mankind will not wholly perish
  before the ending, but that they will, nevertheless, have a short death
  who shall then be found in life; for heavenly fire will pass over all the
  world with one burning, and the dead will arise from their graves with
  that fire, and the living will be slain by the fire's heat, and
  straightways after requickened to eternity. The fire will in no wise
  injure the righteous who had before been cleansed from sins; but
  whosoever is uncleansed shall eat the fire's breath; and we shall then
  all come to the doom. The doom will be deemed on no earthly field, but
  will be as the apostle here above in this lesson said, that we shall be
  seized up in clouds towards Christ, through the air; and there will be
  the separation of righteous and impious men. The righteous will
  afterwards dwell nowhere but with God in the kingdom of heaven, and the
  impious nowhere but with the devil in hell-torments.</p>

  <p>My brothers, set the remembrance of this day before your eyes, and
  whatsoever now appears to be trouble, it shall all be mitigated on
  comparison with it. Correct your lives, and change your conduct, punish
  your evil deeds with weeping, withstand the temptations of the devil;
  eschew evil and do good, and ye will be by so much the more secure at the
  advent of the eternal Judge, as ye now with terror anticipate his
  severity. The prophet said, that the great day of God is very near at
  hand and very swift. Though there were yet another thousand years to that
  day, it would not be long; for whatsoever ends is short and quick, and
  will be as it had never been, when it is ended. But though it were long
  to that day, as it is not, yet will our time not be long, and at our
  ending it will be adjudged to us, whether we in rest or in torment shall
  await the common doom. Let us, therefore, profit by the time which God
  has given us, and merit the everlasting life with him who liveth and
  reigneth for ever and ever. Amen.</p>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
